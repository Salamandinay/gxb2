1,Palace under the Sea,Eve,"This coastline looks exactly like the one drawn on the treasure map. So, the Treasures of the Palace under the Sea are not a legend after all.",
2,,Eve,"I wasn't expecting this when I decided to infiltrate Yume Academy, but it is a pleasant surprise.",
3,,Eve,"If the Treasure comes into my possession, I will have more than enough funds for my goal. I have to get my hands on it somehow.",
4,,Eve,"Hmm, I will need help with carrying all that treasure… the Dragon rumored to guard its hoard fiercely may pose problems as well.",
5,,Wildtress,It's time for free all-you-can-eat barbeque! Where is the restaurant?!,
6,,Wildtress,"Whoa, Eve, that costume is super awesome!",
7,,Eve,"And help has appeared at an opportune moment. One that is both powerful and guileless, no less!",
8,,Eve,"Ah, do you like this outfit? If you can help me with a small favor, then I will gladly gift you a set in return.",
9,,Wildtress,"A full set…? But meat is more important! Quinie won't leave any for me if I'm late, so thanks but no thanks!",
10,,Eve,"Hmm… How about this: if you help me, you can both have the outfit AND eat as much meat as you want. Not a bad deal, is it?",
11,,Wildtress,As much as I want? And I don't even have to fight Quinie for them?,
12,,Eve,"Nope, they would all be yours.\n(This would be nothing compared to the immense amount of treasure hidden within the Palace…)",
13,,Wildtress,"Okay, then I'm in! I'll do whatever you want me to!",
14,,Eve,"This is the location indicated on the treasure map. No Dragon in sight… Well, I suppose that's one less complication to worry about.",
15,,Eve,"Wildtress, I need your help with loading these treasures onto the ship. When we return to land, I will buy you the costume and barbeque as promised.",
16,,Wildtress,"Leave it all to me, Eve! I'll have all of them loaded in no time!",
17,,Eve,"Good girl. Simpleminded enough to not be enticed by the treasure, and as well behaved as my faithful companions.",
18,,Wildtress,"Phew, that's the last of them! I'm starving!",
19,,Eve,Don't worry; I treat helpful and well-behaved dogs well. You will get the barbeque that you wanted.,
20,,Wildtress,"Uh, dogs?",
21,,Dragon,ROAR!!,
22,,Wildtress,"That's a super loud snore. Whoever this is, I bet they are having the time of their life sleeping, just like how I will be having the time of my life gorging on meat!",
23,,Eve,"Shh, that's the sound of the Dragon. Let's get out of here…",
24,,Wildtress,"I got the job done, I want my meat!",
25,,Eve,"Not exactly, we still have to get the treasure to my secret hideout.",
26,,Wildtress,I'm hungry! I want meat! A lot of meat!,
27,,Eve,"Don't start misbehaving now. Naughty dogs get punished, and we wouldn't want that, would we?",
28,,Wildtress,(Gulps),
29,,Eve,"Aw, have I frightened you? Good girls don't get punished, so behave, okay?",
30,,Wildtress,Fiiiiine…,
31,,,"Wildtress returned to the treasure-filled cabin, sniffling sadly.",
32,,Wildtress,"No new cool outfit, no barbeque, no meat in my belly... But I brought my own meat! (Nom nom nom)",
33,,Wildtress,"…Annnd it's gone. No meat for Eve, who doesn't keep her end of the bargain!",
34,,,"Wildtress threw the huge bone angrily, and it crashed into the walls of the cabin with a loud noise.",
35,,Eve,"(Eve, from outside the cabin) What was that sound?",
36,,Wildtress,N-nothing! It's nothing!,
37,,Wildtress,"Oh no, oh no, there is a huge hole in the wall of the ship! Eve will be scary again. What should I do, what should I do?",
38,,Wildtress,Aha! I can cover the hole with these shinies!,
39,Owner of the Palace,Raenvya,(Yawns),
40,,？？？,"I knew you'd sleep well here, Vivie!",
41,,Raenvya,……,
42,,？？？,Why are you looking at me like I'm a stranger? Have you lost your memory in your dreams?,
43,,？？？,That's so cruel of you…,
44,,Raenvya,"…I just needed some time after waking up. Of course I remember you, Poseidia.",
45,,Raenvya,"How can I forget the over-friendly Goddess of the Sea who arrived at the Academy under mysterious circumstances, and pestered me every day until I agreed to be her friend?",
46,,Poseidia,I wouldn't call that pestering! I was just that good to recognize your awesomeness at first sight.,
47,,Poseidia,"I can't believe you talked about the beautiful start of our friendship like that! I'm so holding a grudge against you, and I'll ignore you for, like, three seconds! That'll show you!",
48,,Raenvya,"…Anyway, thank you for inviting me here for vacation. It has been a while since I slept so soundly.",
49,,Raenvya,How did you know that this would cure my insomnia?,
50,,Poseidia,"You see, a friend of mine is a Sea Serpent, and this is her favorite palace among all the palaces of mine! She used to take decade-long naps here.",
51,,Poseidia,"Sea Serpents and Silver Drakes are technically both Dragonkind, right? So I thought you might like it here too!",
52,,Poseidia,"You should remember to rest now and then, Vivie. Your work ethic is admirable, but it's not worth messing up your sleeping schedule.",
53,,Poseidia,"Take a page from me; I'm relaxed all the time! I know your work means a lot to you, but your health is important too! Don't end up like Big Sis…",
54,,Raenvya,"Of course, of course. I'll make sure to take care of myself.",
55,,Poseidia,"No, you won't. That is the tone of someone who says that they will change but will do nothing! Like my Big Sis…Everything I say goes in one ear of hers and comes out the other.",
56,,Poseidia,"You really should, though. Did you know how loud you snored last night?",
57,,Poseidia,They were like ROAR!,
58,,Raenvya,"Wh-what?! I, I didn't know I snored…",
59,,Raenvya,Did I wake you up with my snoring?,
60,,Poseidia,It's okay! I'm used to it now. My Sea Serpent friend snores like this all the time.,
61,,Poseidia,"It shows that she is comfortable here, so I take the snores as a compliment!",
62,,Raenvya,"Ah, yes, regarding your Sea Serpent friend. You said that we're both Dragonkind? Can you tell me more about her?",
63,,Poseidia,"Well, yes, but you would be very distant relatives. Have you never met other Dragonkind before?",
64,,Raenvya,"I haven't. My first memories were of living alone in the mountains, and I never had the chance to meet others of my kind.",
65,,Poseidia,Alright then! So my friend was like…,
66,,,Poseidia started to recount stories of her friend happily.,
67,,Poseidia,"She loves to hoard, and she would use my palaces as her vaults.",
68,,Poseidia,I thought all Dragonkind loved shinies until I met you. Or perhaps Silver Drakes don't like to hoard like other Dragons do?,
69,,Raenvya,"Hold on, Poseidia. Speaking of treasure… Where are they?",
70,,,……,
71,,,……,
72,,Poseidia,"Oh, I had no idea gold diffused in water!",
73,,Raenvya,"No, no, they don't. Have they been whisked away by the currents? Or perhaps they were stolen…",
74,,Poseidia,"Hmm… I have placed wards around my palace that prevents things from being washed away by currents, and the treasures were here for centuries now…",
75,,Raenvya,Then I'm afraid this means someone has stolen them.,
76,,Poseidia,"…You look mad, Vivie.",
77,,Raenvya,The world is a mess because of people who shamelessly commit such crimes. I will assist you to retrieve the treasure!,
78,,Poseidia,"Actually, it's nothing... You know what? Let's just go on a treasure hunt! This will be fun!",
79,"Speak to Hermes, the Informed One",Raenvya,A thief will need to fence the items they have stolen. We should start searching the coast that we came from for clues.,
80,,Raenvya,The first step would be asking the others whether they've seen anyone suspicious.,
81,,Poseidia,"Look, it's Hermes' stand! She is watching out for potential customers all the time, so she might have seen our burglar!",
82,,Hermes,"Frexie, stop slacking off, we have customers. Do you want to pay back your debts or not?",
83,,Frexie,(Mutters) I hate that old hag…,
84,,Hermes,I heard that.,
85,,Frexie,(Laughs sheepishly) Welcome! Feel free to browse. Is there anything that catches your eye?,
86,,Raenvya,We're not here to shop.,
87,,Poseidia,"Hmm, I'm starting to crave ice cream, but there are no stores in sight that are selling them.",
88,,Frexie,"Ugh, if only I had my Spicy Wasabi Soy Sauce Ice Cream cart… Please just buy something, you won't regret it!",
89,,Frexie,"If you buy 100,000 Coins worth of products, you can get a unique Frexie plushie for free! It is one of a kind!",
90,,Raenvya,"No, thank you. We're searching for a thief. Have you noticed any suspicious figures lurking in this region, Hermes?",
91,,Hermes,I don't think I have. The most suspicious person I saw is Frexie here.,
92,,Frexie,"Hey, you're the one who told me to attract the customers like this!",
93,,Poseidia,I am pretty curious though. Shouldn't Frexie be working on her new prank instead of working for Hermes?,
94,,Frexie,You know me so well. But I didn't get the chance to sell any Spicy Wasabi Soy Sauce Ice Cream before my cart is gone.,
95,,Raenvya,Gone? Could it perhaps be…,
96,,Hermes,"Oh, no, it wasn't stolen. There was a storm last night, and the tents and parasols we placed on the beach were a mess when we checked in the morning.",
97,,Hermes,Her poor cart wasn't spared either.,
98,,Raenvya,"A storm, hmm? I didn't notice it since I was underwater all night. Was anyone hurt?",
99,,Hermes,"Thankfully, no. The Inn's walls were sturdy.",
100,,Poseidia,"Huh, that's strange. There shouldn't be storms close to shore these days…",
101,,Hermes,"Haha, so it seems like there are things beyond the grasp of the almighty Lord of the Seas.",
102,,Poseidia,"Nah, I wouldn't call myself that. There are a lot of things I don't know.",
103,Make a Purchase,Poseidia,"I'll take one of these, one of these, and…one of those, please.",
104,,Frexie,"Oooooh! Thank you, it would be 114,514 Coins in total. Would you like to pay by cash or card?",
105,,Frexie,"Thank you, thank you so much, Poseidia!",
106,,Poseidia,"By the way, why are you working for Hermes?",
107,,Raenvya,"If my memory serves me right, Hermes mentioned a debt.",
108,,Frexie,"Ugh, it all happened yesterday.",
109,,Frexie,I finally had all the ingredients for my Spicy Wasabi Soy Sauce Ice Cream ready last night and decided to take a nap on the beach because I was exhausted.,
110,,Hermes,"When I arrived at the scene in the morning, my stand was in pieces, and Frexie was sleeping soundly in what remained of my stand.",
111,,Frexie,"Hermes requested that I compensate her for her loss, but I didn't have any money, so I had to work my debts off.",
112,,Raenvya,"Wait a minute, wasn't the stand destroyed by the storm? What did it have to do with Frexie?",
113,,Frexie,That's what I thought! But…,
114,,Hermes,"My stand was built with wind resistant materials, and wouldn't have suffered any damage if the storm hadn't lifted Frexie and crashed her into it.",
115,,Frexie,"…So I'm now indebted to Hermes. When I have paid off all of the money owed, please come back to taste my Spicy Wasabi Soy Sauce Ice Cream!",
116,,Poseidia,"Definitely! Vivie, you should come too. Trying out new things will be good for you!",
117,,Raenvya,"No, thank you. I have important matters to tend to, and no time to spare for such frivolities.",
118,,Poseidia,"Aww, that's exactly what Big Sis would have said… On second thought, you might even be worse than her!",
119,,Poseidia,"I'm actually very impressed by you, Fre-fre! You took responsibility instead of running away from your mistakes.",
120,,Frexie,…Huh?,
121,,Poseidia,I thought you would have just denied her request for compensation...,
122,,Frexie,"…Wait, I can do that?",
123,,Frexie,And it isn't even out of character for me to do so! I'm off then~,
124,,Poseidia,Ooops… Do I need to pay Frexie's debts for her if I accidentally persuaded her to leave?,
125,,Hermes,"Haha, I don't think it would be necessary. My stand is insured, after all, and all I need to do to have my losses compensated would be to contact the insurance company.",
126,,Poseidia,"But, Fre-Fre said…",
127,,Hermes,"I needed someone to run the stand, and she was right there. Besides, it's not like she was working for free: a portion of her sales was transferred to her bank account.",
128,,Raenvya,"That settles everything, I believe. We should ask others if they have seen anyone acting suspiciously around here.",
129,,Raenvya,"Ah, it almost slipped my mind: what about the plushie Frexie mentioned? Poseidia did purchase 100,000 Coins worth of wares, after all.",
130,,Hermes,"Oh, the plushie that Frexie made herself? Unfortunately, it has been gifted to Priestess, who made a stop here sometime earlier.",
131,,Hermes,"Obsessed with repaying her debts, Frexie probably forgot that the plushie was already given to someone else.",
132,"Speak to KongMing, the Wise One",Raenvya,"Look, KongMing is fishing in the distance. She is wise beyond her years; perhaps she would be able to get to the bottom of this mystery.",
133,,KongMing,"I do not mean to eavesdrop, but I have caught a word or two of your conversation. I am just like any other average person, and far from the omniscient entity that you make me out to be.",
134,,Poseidia,"Woah, if your IQ is that of an average person, then mine would probably be that of… an average idiot?",
135,,Raenvya,"I wouldn't take what KongMing said to heart, Poseidia. She is just being modest about her intelligence.",
136,,Kong Ming,"Ah, no, I truly believe I am average. In fact, there is no difference between you and me in the grand scheme of things.",
137,,KongMing,Even Gods and Goddesses cannot escape the rules of nature and the universe… we are equally insignificant.,
138,,Poseidia,"O-okay…I'd be lying if I said I understood everything, but you got one thing right: I am pretty useless!",
139,,KongMing,"That was not my intention… No, it's pointless to dwell on this topic. What were you about to ask of me?",
140,,,Raenvya explained the situation of the missing treasure to KongMing.,
141,,KongMing,"Ah, I see. I do have theories, but I am not certain whether they will be of help.",
142,,KongMing,"Legends speak of treasures hidden in a ""Palace under the Sea"". While there is no proof of the existence of such treasures, countless pirates have come here in search of them.",
143,,KongMing,"From what you just told me, the legends seem to be true. Perhaps the treasures you seek have been taken by pirates?",
144,,Raenvya,"Hmm… Pirates tend to build their lairs on well-hidden islands, but in this specific case, they might still be sailing on the sea. We should watch out for both.",
145,,Raenvya,"Thank you, KongMing. We should search for clues elsewhere…",
146,,Poseidia,"Hold on, I have something to ask KongMing! Your hook isn't bent like other hooks, and there is no bait either. Fishes won't bite what isn't there…Are you sure you're fishing, not just dangling a needle in the water?",
147,,KongMing,"If the fish wishes to, it will bite the hook no matter whether there is bait attached to it. I am fishing…or, more accurately, I am debating Taoism.",
148,,Poseidia,"No, they won't, they're not stupid! And who are you debating Taoism with? I can't see anyone… is this another one of your smart people games?",
149,,KongMing,"In layman's terms, I am having a fishing contest with Priestess. The person who catches more fish wins.",
150,,Poseidia,"Ooooh, so you're having a fishing contest! By the way, I still think that you will lose at this rate.",
151,,KongMing,"The point of our debate is not the result of the contest; the important part is the insights we gain as we fish… Ah, the float has sunk.",
152,,Poseidia,"What?! It's all my fault for being a stupid ruler… Under my rule, the good people of the sea have become idiots too!",
153,,KongMing,"You need not worry, Poseidia. It is not a fish that has been caught on my hook.",
154,,Poseidia,"Phew, that sounds about right. I knew no one would be stupid enough to fall for that!",
155,,KongMing,This is a…plushie of Frexie? Curious that it should appear here. I should probably return it to her when I see her next time.,
156,,KongMing,"Although I haven't caught any fish, I did catch a plushie. Such are the surprises of life… I can feel myself verging on a breakthrough…",
157,,Poseidia,"KongMing is in a very strange state. Is this what happens when one tries to ""debate Taoism""? Seems fun! You should totally try this, Vivie!",
158,,Raenvya,Me? I think we should focus on pursuing the thief instead of wasting time on this.,
159,,KongMing,"(Ah, I see what you're doing there, Poseidia.)",
160,,KongMing,"Not so fast. I just remembered another clue. However, I am reluctant to part with it… unless bribed with fish.",
161,,Raenvya,"Uh, why? I thought the result wasn't the point of your contest?",
162,,KongMing,"While the result is not of great importance, it would be humiliating if I showed up empty-handed.",
163,,KongMing,I can provide you with a fishing rod and bait if you require one.,
164,,Poseidia,"Look, Vivie, KongMing even agrees to lend you her fishing rod! My lost treasure hinges on you catching one fish for her! Just one!",
165,,Raenvya,"…In this case, I would be willing to oblige.",
166,,,"Raenvya cast the line and waited patiently for a while. Soon, a small fish bit the bait.",
167,,KongMing,"A clue… a clue… Ah, I got it! I heard rumors of a Deep Sea Monster inhabiting these waters in a nearby village.",
168,,KongMing,"The monster would submerge the village under water and rob them of their possessions. However, I am unable to verify the authenticity of this rumor since no one has seen it.",
169,,Raenvya,Deep Sea Monsters… Such stories usually stem from the fear that mankind harbors toward natural disasters.,
170,,Raenvya,"I find KongMing's tone rather unnatural… But she IS KongMing, so I probably should take the clues she provided seriously…",
171,Explore the Strange Islet,Raenvya,"Look, there is a strange small island in the distance. Can it be the Pirates' Lair?",
172,,Poseidia,"Let's go, let's go! I can't wait to see what fun awaits us!",
173,,Dracula,"Rise, my servants! Your Lord has requested your presence!",
174,,Dracula,"You shall conquer the world under my name, and strike the fear of vampires into the hearts of humans!",
175,,Poseidia,"Pfft, Dracula looks sooo elegant and composed, but what she says is so cringe-worthy…",
176,,Dracula,"Show yourselves, honorless eavesdroppers!",
177,,Poseidia,"Yo, Dracula, it's Raenvya and me! What are you doing here?",
178,,Dracula,"Khm, nothing noteworthy, I'm afraid, just passing the time. What brings you here to this inconspicuous islet?",
179,,,Raenvya explained the situation of the missing treasures to Dracula.,
180,,Dracula,"Treasures, wealth… If they come into my possession, I would…",
181,,Poseidia,"Uh, hello? Earth to Dracula?",
182,,Dracula,"Khm, my apologies. Would you mind repeating what you just said?",
183,,Raenvya,"We were asking whether you have seen any suspicious-looking individuals around here, such as Pirates.",
184,,Dracula,"I'm afraid not. Before you came, I was the only inhabitant of this island.",
185,,Raenvya,Why are you so certain?,
186,,Dracula,I have my ways... but I might be wrong. Feel free to look around and see for yourself.,
187,,Raenvya,I suppose we're not getting any clues from you.,
188,,Dracula,That's because I have none. I'd prefer it if you left me alone; I could use some peace and quiet.,
189,,,Raenvya and Poseidia wandered around the island.,
190,,Raenvya,"It is deserted, just as Dracula said. The only living beings here except for us are just Dracula and her raven.",
191,,Raenvya,We should probably search for clues elsewhere.,
192,,Poseidia,Wait! Are you sure it's okay for us to leave like that?,
193,,Poseidia,Do you still remember what Dracula said when we arrived on this island?,
194,,Raenvya,The ones about world domination as she played with bubbles? I thought she was just playing pretend.,
195,,Poseidia,You don't know for sure! What if she really is creating an army of bubble warriors under the guise of playing?,
196,,Poseidia,"This is Dracula, the Lord of Vampires, that we are talking about here! If she really succeeds at creating an army, the world would be in danger!",
197,,Raenvya,You… have a point. I didn't think of this possibility. What should we do?,
198,,Poseidia,"Heh heh heh, we should pop every bubble that she made!",
199,,Raenvya,…Wouldn't it be more efficient if we just forced Dracula to return to the Academy?,
200,,Poseidia,"It would, but we don't have incriminating proof, do we? She can claim that she's just playing with bubbles and be let off the hook this time, and we won’t always be able to keep an eye on her…",
201,,Poseidia,"Nope, the best option is to pop all these bubbles. This way, she'll know that we know about her nefarious plans, and she'll owe us a favor because we didn't report her to the Academy authorities!",
202,,Poseidia,"We would have some leverage over her this way, which is way better than, say, going into all out-war with her!",
203,,Raenvya,…Fine.,
204,,,The duo then spent some time chasing and popping the bat-shaped bubbles on the islet.,
205,"Speak to Sivney, the Flying One",Poseidia,"Now that I think about it, we can't rule out the possibility of the culprit being another Sea Serpent.",
206,,Raenvya,"A viable theory: considering where the treasure was stolen from, any deep sea creature could have been the thief.",
207,,Raenvya,We should consider searching the deeper depths of the sea for clues as well.,
208,,Sivney,Woo-hoo~,
209,,Raenvya,Is someone flying…Dr. Sivney?!,
210,,Sivney,Hello there! What brings you to the Open Sea? It can get quite dangerous over here.,
211,,Sivney,"Well, I probably don't have to worry if the Lord of the Seas is with you.",
212,,Raenvya,"You act very differently here compared to when you were in your lab, Dr. Sivney.",
213,,Sivney,"Work hard, play hard, that's my motto~",
214,,Sivney,"I've been looking forward to this vacation for quite a while now, and the efforts of building this water jet pack totally paid off!",
215,,Raenvya,That explains the delay in the research progress… If only this time was dedicated to the research…,
216,,Sivney,All work and no play make Sivney a dull researcher.,
217,,Sivney,"Inspiration only strikes when I'm relaxed. Besides, I'm a genius, not one of those blockheads who can't achieve anything without throwing all their time into it. The delayed progress can be made up for swiftly.",
218,,Raenvya,"I wouldn't be surprised if you could, but I would appreciate you finishing the work at hand first, especially when there's so much waiting to be done.",
219,,Poseidia,"Whoa, this looks fun!",
220,,Sivney,"Well, at least Poseidia is in the correct mindset. It's important to set aside all work-related thoughts when on vacation. Inspiration strikes easier this way~",
221,,Sivney,"Do you want to have a try? Senpai tried it too, and he definitely liked it~",
222,,Poseidia,YES!,
223,,Raenvya,"Poseidia, have you perhaps forgotten that we're still in pursuit of our thief? The longer we tarry, the distance they will put between us and them. You can try it after we catch the thief.",
224,,Poseidia,But…I want to try it now…,
225,,Sivney,Thief? Sounds like an intriguing story. Do you mind telling me what's going on?,
226,,Raenvya,"Ah, I was just about to ask you about this matter. You see…",
227,,,Raenvya recounted the events that led up to the present.,
228,,Raenvya,Have you perhaps noticed anything pertinent to our search when you were airborne?,
229,,Sivney,"Lemme think… Ah, I have! I saw a small, moving black dot somewhere when I was flying high above the water.",
230,,Sivney,The size of the black dot seems fitting for a ship. Perhaps it belonged to your thief?,
231,,Raenvya,That's plausible. Did you happen to see where it went too?,
232,,Sivney,"I might, but I can't remember.",
233,,Raenvya,Uh… Would you mind flying up again and locating the ship for us?,
234,,Sivney,"I would, actually. If you want to know so badly, then check it yourself.",
235,,Raenvya,"Why am I not surprised… All right then, Poseidia, here is your chance to try the jet pack.",
236,,Poseidia,"Erm, well, you see… I'm actually afraid of heights!",
237,,Raenvya,I seem to remember that you frequently visit points of high elevation in the Academy…?,
238,,Poseidia,"But, but… I'm a fish! What if I send myself right into the beaks of some carnivorous bird?!",
239,,Poseidia,"I'd be eaten alive, and that would be BAD! No, you do the honors.",
240,,Raenvya,"I guess I have no choice, do I?",
241,,,Raenvya put on the jet pack and flew in the air for a long time.,
242,Head towards the Mysterious Black Dot,Raenvya,I feel so dizzy…,
243,,Poseidia,How do you feel? Do we need to return to the beach so you can rest for a while?,
244,,Raenvya,"No, we don't have to do that. I just rolled a bit in the air when I was trying to get the hang of Dr. Sivney's contraption.",
245,,Raenvya,"Unfortunately, the view in the air wasn't very good, and I was only able to see the rough shape of something in this direction.",
246,,Poseidia,"But there are no ships or boats nearby. If there were, we would have seen them by now.",
247,,？？？,Help…Is anyone out there… Help me… SOS…,
248,,Raenvya,Did you hear that? Someone is crying for help! They might be drowning. Let's go!,
249,,Raenvya,"Uh, Priestess?",
250,,Priestess,Finally…,
251,,Raenvya,"I'm relieved that no one is drowning, but you don't seem to be in any immediate danger either. Why have you cried for help? Were you too exhausted to make it back to shore?",
252,,Priestess,"No, it's worse: I can't swim.",
253,,Poseidia,"Wait, you can't swim?? Then how did you make it so far out in the sea?!",
254,,Priestess,"Now that is a long story: KongMing and I agreed to have a debate on Taoism through fishing, so I bought some fishing supplies from Hermes' stand.",
255,,Priestess,"I tried my luck at the beach, but no fish bit the bait. I suspect they were all scared away by the storm last night.",
256,,Priestess,"Since there were none close to shore, I figured that I should venture further out into the sea if I want to catch any fish, and bought a floating ring. At the time, I thought there would be no problems if I stayed close enough to the beach.",
257,,Priestess,"I wasn't able to, as I encountered some huge waves which swept away my other belongings and brought me here.",
258,,Priestess,"After entering the Open Sea, these schools of fish started to gather around my float. I have narrowly avoided the float being tipped over several times already.",
259,,Poseidia,"Well, that's the sea to you. Peaceful one moment, raging the next. These sea creatures are saying that they like you, though.",
260,,Priestess,"I am aware; my ability to communicate with nature grants me the ability to understand animals as well. However, their enthusiasm can be rather…overwhelming.",
261,,Poseidia,"Yeah, they can be a bit overbearing sometimes. It's how they express their affections for you~",
262,,Priestess,"I could use some help here, if you don't mind.",
263,,Raenvya,"Don't worry, we'll think of something. Hmm… Poseidia, could you call upon some waves to carry her back to shore?",
264,,Priestess,"No, no, no, no. That is a bad idea. This little floating ring is not built to face the forces of waves, and I really don't want it to tip over.",
265,,Poseidia,"She looks scared, Vivie. I think it's better if we push her back to the beach.",
266,,Raenvya,"But that would take more time than… We don't have a better option, do we?",
267,,,Raenvya and Poseidia gently pushed Priestess' floating ring back to the beach as they swam. Schools of fish swam beside them all the way.,
268,,Poseidia,"Wow, I have never been surrounded by this many fishes before, and they're all so pretty! I'm so jealous of you, Priestess.",
269,,Priestess,"I do like nature, as long as I'm not caught in the middle of the ocean. I wonder why did I attract such a large number of fish… Perhaps my abilities were enhanced unwittingly.",
270,,Poseidia,"I would kill for such affinity to nature… On second thought, I wouldn't, but you get the point. You agree with me, don't you, Vivie?",
271,,Raenvya,"It was indeed a breathtaking sight, and reminded me of my homeland. It has been a while since I am able to properly appreciate such a beautiful scene.",
272,,Priestess,"I would appreciate it a lot if they tamped down their enthusiasm. Anyway, thank you for bringing me back to shore.",
273,,Priestess,I would have been stranded there for days if you hadn't saved me.,
274,,Raenvya,"Ah, before we go, Priestess, there is something we need to ask you about.",
275,,,Raenvya explained the situation of the lost treasures to Priestess.,
276,,Priestess,"Hmm… I'm sorry, I'm drawing a blank here. I was too nervous that I was going to drown to take note of my surroundings.",
277,,Raenvya,"It's fine, Priestess. We will check with the others to see if they've seen anything.",
278,Where did the Treasure go?,Raenvya,Stop right there!,
279,,Wildtress,"Uh, Eve? I think someone is demanding us to stop?",
280,,Eve,"Are they after the treasures too? Tch, proceed at full speed!",
281,,Raenvya,"That ship is acting rather suspiciously. If they have nothing to hide, why would they start accelerating? We should pursue it!",
282,,Poseidia,"Are we chasing that ship? Great! No one escapes from me on the sea! Hold on, Vivie, let's goooooooo!",
283,,,"Every wisp of wind and every droplet of water in the sea moved upon Poseidia's will. Soon, the ship stopped.",
284,,Wildtress,I surrender! I surrender!,
285,,Eve,"Stop it, you're going to overturn the ship! If it's the treasures that you're after, I am down to negotiation…",
286,,Raenvya,"Unlike you, we're here to retrieve what is rightfully Poseidia's.",
287,,Raenvya,"Cease resisting at once. While we are fellow students of Yume Academy, I do not condone such behavior.",
288,,Raenvya,I will make sure that you receive appropriate punishment after returning to the Academy.,
289,,Eve,"Wait, wait, it's all a great misunderstanding! I thought the treasures belonged to no one…",
290,,,Eve told Raenvya and Poseidia about the treasure map and the legends about the treasure in the Palace under the Sea.,
291,,Raenvya,"Hmm… an understandable mistake to make. However, this doesn't change the fact that these treasures belong to Poseidia, and you should return them regardless.",
292,,Eve,"Of course, of course. Just give me some time to unload them from the cabin…",
293,,Eve,"(…And no one will be the wiser if I keep some for myself, right?)",
294,,Raenvya,"Finally, this is coming to an end…",
295,,Eve's Voice,WHAT?!,
296,,Poseidia,What's wrong?,
297,,Eve,"Oh no, all the treasures are gone, and there is a gaping hole on the cabin walls!",
298,,Wildtress,Don't look at me! This has nothing to do with me!,
299,,Raenvya,Are you trying to fool us by claiming all the treasure is missing? Where did you hide them?,
300,,Eve,"Most certainly not! Look at this hole; if I made it just now, you would definitely have heard some noise!",
301,,,Everyone peered into the wide hole on the walls of the ship's cabin.,
302,,Eve,"Perhaps the treasures fell out of the hole? But this makes no sense… The hole isn't on the ground, so there should at least be some left…",
303,,Raenvya,Strange. Do you have any guesses as to how this could have happened?,
304,,Eve,"Hmm… Wasn't there a huge sound in the cabin earlier, Wildtress?",
305,,Wildtress,"I,I,I didn't do anything!",
306,,Poseidia,"Hold on, there's a scale here… I think I know where the treasures are.",
307,Dive into the depths,,(The two dove into the deep sea.),
308,,？？？,ROAR!!,
309,,Raenvya,"What a vile, greedy creature. Not only have you taken what does not belong to you, but you have also trespassed on private property. Be prepared to face your punishment!",
310,,,A fierce battle ensued...,
311,,？？？,(Whimpers),
312,,Raenvya,"Uh, am I mistaken, or is it… whining?",
313,,Poseidia,"There, there. You'll be fine~",
314,,Poseidia,"Oh, this is my Sea Serpent friend! I think she was the one who caused the storm last night.",
315,,Raenvya,Wh-what?! You could have told us before we started to fight…,
316,,Poseidia,"I thought all Dragonkind loved to fight, and it might cheer you up!",
317,,Poseidia,"She was pretty excited to fight with you, and thanks to her thick scales, she's not even wounded that badly!",
318,,Raenvya,"Well, moving a bit did feel nice...",
319,,Raenvya,"I am both having a sense of accomplishment for a job well done, and a sense of frustration that I wasted an entire day.",
320,,Poseidia,Wasted…Didn't you enjoy any of it?,
321,,Raenvya,"…Ah. The point of today wasn't the treasure, was it?",
322,,Raenvya,"Fishing, the jet pack, chasing after bubbles, the schools of fish, and all the others…",
323,,Raenvya,You roped me into all of these frivolous activities to entertain me.,
324,,Poseidia,"Are you mad at me, Vivie? I thought it was a chance to help you relax a little.",
325,,Poseidia,You've overworked yourself to the point of insomnia. That is not good for your health.,
326,,Raenvya,I am mad.,
327,,Raenvya,"But I'm too tired to be properly mad at you after running around in circles the whole day, so I'll take a nap in your Palace.",
328,,,Roars of another Dragonkind rang from the Palace again as the Silver Drake snored.,
329,,？？？,(Whimpers),
330,,Poseidia,(Mentally gives herself a pat on the back),
331,Epilogue,Wildtress,I want meat! A lot of meat! And don’t you forget my new outfit!,
332,,Eve,"Fine, fine…",
333,,Wildtress,I look so cool! Am I not the coolest?,
334,,Eve,"Yes, yes you are. Now go have your barbeque, and I can finally be free from this nightmare.",
335,,Wildtress,(Nom nom nom) More!,
336,,Wildtress,Barbeque tastes so much better when I don't have to fight Quinie for any~,
337,,Eve,My wallet cannot take this… Where is she storing all those food in her small body?,
338,,Wildtress,"Whew, I haven't been so full in quite a while! Eve isn't so bad when she's not scary!",
339,,Wildtress,Why did she take off as soon as she finished paying? We could hang out together as friends!,
340,,Wildtress,Just like them!,
341,,Raenvya,"(Walking in quick, hurried steps)",
342,,Poseidia,"Just one bite, Vivie, one bite!",
343,,Raenvya,"I don't have the time for this. I have reached a critical point in my research, and I need to get those samples.",
344,,Poseidia,"You can eat while you walk! Chewing and walking can be done at the same time, right?",
345,,Raenvya,(Takes a bite of the Spicy Wasabi Soy Sauce Ice Cream) Fine. Happy now?,
346,,Poseidia,"Awww, I was looking forward to the face you would make at the taste... But your expression didn't change at all!",
347,,Frexie,"This makes no sense… Should I add more Wasabi, Soy sauce, or chili sauce? Hmm…",
348,,Frexie,(Licks the Spicy Wasabi Soy Sauce Ice Cream) AHHHHHHH!!! MY TONGUE BURNS!! AHHHHHH!!!,
