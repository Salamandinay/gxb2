11,Epilogue,
12,Speak to Diana,"""Little ones, behave."" Diana's pets chase the two and keep splashing them with water. There seems to be no escape unless they are bested in a water fight."
13,Take a glance at the cat,"""Do you want to pet it? I don't think it minds."" A small, soft, and warm body lands in Raenvya's arms. It purrs contently."
14,Speak to Hermes,"""Feel free to browse and purchase anything that catches your eye~ It's okay if you don't, too. Here, have some of these as a souvenir."" Hermes seems to be feeling generous today. The two receive some outlandish toys from her."
15,Speak to Frexie,"""Spicy Wasabi Soy Sauce Ice Cream is still unavailable at the moment, but I have normal ice cream too!"" Frexie gestures animatedly at the two and hands both of them a nice, normal ice cream cone."
16,See what Cupid is doing,"Cupid is randomly shooting beams of love magic into the water, causing havoc in the schools of fish. She will completely disrupt the ecosystem of the ocean at this rate! She needs to be stopped!"
17,Why is she dancing on the sea surface?,The two are mesmerized by the entrancing dance of the fallen goddess. They watch her dance for a long time.
18,Speak to KongMing,"""Do you want to try fishing again? Here, have my fishing rod."" KongMing places the Fishing Rod in their hands before they had the chance to refuse."
19,See what Dracula is doing,"""Where did all the bubbles go? Were they too fragile? I should strengthen them with my magicâ€¦"" For the sake of the world, they take it upon themselves to vanquish the Vampire Lord's evil bubbles again."
20,Observe the antics of a weirdo,"""Who are you calling a weirdo?! You are now chosen by me to be magical girls, so go out there and create miracles! Shoo!"" A strange person yells at the two while holding a transformation belt. Luckily, there is no one else here to witness her shenanigans."
21,Model for a painting,"The two receive a portrait for their time. Raenvya thinks taking a photo would be faster if they wanted something to remember this with, but she is wise enough not to mention this in front of Elysia."
22,Speak to Sivney,"""Come on, let's have another go!"" Sivney grabbed their hands as she took off and performed a loop in the air."
23,Return to where you met Priestess,"Thanks to the two, Priestess has returned to the Beach safely. However, her scent lingers, so the glittering fishes haven't dispersed yet. They spend some time admiring the scene."
