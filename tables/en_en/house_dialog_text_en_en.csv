1,Iron Fist,KongMing senpai!!! Good morning~
2,KongMing,Good morning~
3,Dracula,"When I'm alone in this dorm, it will be mine to rule!"
4,Saint,Where's Michael? I thought you two are inseparable.
5,Lucifer,"She's got her own business, but that's not your problem."
6,Valeera,"Phoenix is right next to me, what should I say to start the topic?"
7,Phoenix,"Valeera is right next to me, what should I say to start the topic?"
8,Saint,What about a finger guess game right here?
9,Gambler,"That's a good idea! I won't lose this time! Paper, scissor, stone…"
10,Saint,Paper!
11,Gambler,Stone!
12,Librarian,I've got no book to read here… Senpai must be bragging about how he likes to read.
13,Iron Fist 1,Who are you?
14,Iron Fist 2,That's what I'm about to ask. I would never wear this!
15,Iron Fist,"Nooo… The dorm is too humble, there's not even a proper place to sleep…"
16,Iron Fist,A crystal ball? I've never seen snow before… May I get inside and have a look?
17,Lucifer,"Saint, don't you dare try to provoke me!"
18,KongMing,Iron Fist must be in a good mood today~ But…
19,Raphael,"But her prosthetic arm doesn't look good, right?"
20,Raphael,"I've noticed that too, but don't be worried, I believe she can handle this herself."
21,KongMing,I hope so…
22,Bud Elf,Senpai should decorate his dorm with more plants! I need to tell him that later~
23,Sonya,It smells great! They must have developed a new recipe!
24,Mio,Happy Meow Year?
25,Mio,Meow... This dress is too tight for me!
26,Michael,My poster? Gabriel must have sneaked another photo!!!
27,Lucifer,"Michael's poster? Haha, someone's doing a great job here!"
28,Valeera,Never knew Senpai also has a collection of storybooks.
29,Valeera,This story is really weird… The main character is so related to Iron Fist…
30,Iron Fist,A storybook? Well… The story is really interesting!
31,Ithil,Never thought the room can be so tidy.
32,Ithil,Maybe I can help to clean up this room after the next operation is over.
33,CapsuGirl,What's Senpai doing right now? Hope he's not messing up my capsule machine…
34,KongMing,"Every time I wear this dress, it reminds me of the sweet memories with Senpai..."
35,KongMing,Although I predicted this would happen... But I was still surprised that Senpai did it without hesitation.
36,Iron Fist,I'll fight hard for Senpai as always!
37,Sakura,I only hope Senpai can also see the cherry blossom here…
38,Hexa,"Everyone is fighting for justice, I don't see a point to leave me here…"
39,Saint,"So, they're out for another battle? Why they didn't take me with them!"
40,Hottie,Time to plan for my next vocation~
41,Fencer,"Warmth will affect the cast of ice magics… But since I'm not in battle, it's okay to stay here a little bit longer…"
42,Michael,"Let's take a break, and return to work once we recover. Senpai still needs our assistance!"
43,Lucifer,"Light cannot exist without darkness, but people barely recognize this fact. But I believe Senpai knows this very well…"
44,Ennmaya,I hope this room can be a little bit darker. Sadly I cannot remodel Senpai's room privately.
45,Dracula,I smell human in this room. It's been a long time since I last drunk some real human blood…
46,KongMing,It's not bad to be surprised by this.
47,Lucifer,Why do I need to take courses like others? I can become talented through self-study!
48,Valeera,"Phoenix, are you lost? You're running in circles here."
49,Phoenix,How can I be lost in a Dorm room? I'm just looking for the fridge!
50,Michael,"Time to rise and shine, Lucifer~"
51,Lucifer,Ten... more... minutes...
52,Gwen & Brigit,"Gwen: Where hath Jacob gone? Didst the lady finally hadst enow of thy antics?\nBrigit: Gwen will never get tired of me! Look, we're joined at the hip!"
53,Esau,Jacob! Come over here and show them that we're better twins than they are!
54,Psychic,Bruno is very smart! It does 2-digit calculations.
55,Sivney,"Well, Bonnie can do more than that. She makes robots!"
56,Luna,"Hmm…Sweet Taro Cakes, Chestnut Cakes, and cute bunnies…"
57,Angelica,She's talking in her sleep…how adorable!
58,Blair,"You…I remember you, you're very close to Senpai…A THREAT!"
59,Iron Fist,"Um, I feel eyes on me. I should be worried, right…?"
60,Uriel,"Teresa, as a nun, you should refrain from acting like this."
61,Teresa,More wine! More Spicy Fishies!
62,Gambler,"Can I leave now? You haven't won any of the bets, and I'm tired."
63,Rogue,"No, I'm positive about this bet! By the way, do you mind lending me some money? I'll pay you back~"
64,Von Helsing,DRACULA?
65,Dracula,"Woah, you look murderous."
66,Von Helsing,DRACULA!!!
67,Lord Dracula,"Ah, it's you. It's been quite a while since I've tasted the blood of Vampire Hunters…"
68,Joan,"Hmm, what should I have for lunch?"
69,Guan Yin,Stewed Pork with Sauce!
70,Sonya,"Two Stewed Pork with Sauce, coming right up!"
71,Lord Dracula,"Ugh, what did you put in my glass?"
72,Apate,"Oh, nothing too harmful, just some crushed garlic."
73,Aquaris,You look simply stunning in your new gear!
74,N-Gen Iron Fist,Thank you! Though I find myself uncontrollably attracted to sources of light now…
75,Estel,"Vivian, can you ask a question to the stars for me? Will I be caught if I set off fireworks tonight?"
76,Vivian,"The Stars have spoken…""Play to your heart's extent, young Estel, for you will be in detention for the next three days…"""
77,Psychic,"I'm sorry, but you can't have those. These are dog biscuits."
78,Mio,Who says Mio isn't one? Meow!
79,CapsuGirl,"Unfortunately, this Capsule doesn't contain the prize."
80,Monica,… I can turn back time to pick another one…
81,Gabriel,A scoop! And another headline-worthy article! Yes!!
82,KongMing,"… I understand your excitement, but we really can't have another complaint about the News Agency."
83,Wu Kong,Can you ask the Peach Trees in the Academy Gardens to bear fruit faster?
84,Holly,Uh…I don't think I can.
85,Bud Elf,Hmm… these trees seem to be healthy and full of life.
86,Holly,"All thanks to you, Bud Elf."
87,Vera,"Don't worry about the floor, I'll take care of it."
88,Ithil,"No, no, I like cleaning. Let's do this together."
89,Vivian,The stars just gave me a warning… but what for?
90,Amelia,"Hey, Vivian! Are you interested in this shiny new Orb?"
91,Robbie,... Are you an AI too? Erina is glad to meet another one like her…
92,Turin,"Oooh, I never realized that you're one too! Nice to meet you, Erina, I am Turin!"
93,Robbie,"""Hello, Turin. This young one here is Robbie; I am Erina."""
94,Frexie,It… hurts…
95,Raphael,"That's because you ate a poisonous mushroom. Spit it out, quick!"
96,Kassy,Our pets seem to get along with each other.
97,Mio,"They're not pets, they're fam-eowly!"
98,Hermes,"Oh Crystal Child of Miracles, I wish to be the richest person in the world."
99,Krystal,You have to work for that!
100,Pandaria,"It's not impressive at all, just a huge lump of fat!"
101,Robbie,"Huge? Erina is huge, and she protects me…"
102,Blair,"If I kiss Senpai in front of you, we will be together for eternity!"
103,Holly,"Uh, I'm pretty sure you got the wrong plant."
104,Mika,The craftsmanship of this doll is incredible! I should add movable joints to my clay dolls too...
105,Muppet,"Please stop studying my joints, it's creepy…"
106,Hottie,"How did class go? It's nice being teacher for a change, isn't it?"
107,Uriel,This whip could come in handy…
108,Trinity,I have time for a small nap… ZZZ
109,Sivney,And I'll take this time to improve her gear and design her an embarrassing outfit!
110,Sonya,"Vera, for the mental wellbeing of everyone on campus, please stop trying to cook anymore."
111,Vera,But these herbs are good for their health!
112,Valeera,"Librarian, when's the last time you ate anything?"
113,Librarian,"(Stomach rumbles) Read first, food later."
114,Diana,You remind me of the sun. It feels… nostalgic.
115,Angelica,That's because I shot them down. Probably not what you're looking for.
116,Apate,I have a performance tomorrow! Will you come?
117,Lucifer,"Nah, I'll pass. I have rehearsals with the Shining Band."
118,Kassy,"Emotions are not needed in this line of work; if anything, they can even be hindrances."
119,Blair,"Ugh, you're just so boring and certainly no match for me."
120,Teresa,"You, me, and the bar?"
121,Rogue,Now you're talking!
122,Mika,I envy your skill with a shield. You must have had no problems with protecting whoever you vowed to protect.
123,Uriel,"It doesn't matter now, not when I failed to stop the sun from falling before it should."
124,Turin,Turin's Game is no game at all. It is a tool used to trap and control Servants.
125,Caitlyn,You know what? I've heard of a video game that works exactly that way!
126,Psychic,"Wow, a mermaid! But what do mermaids need to sustain themselves?"
127,Himoto,"Chips, soda, and comic books!"
128,Aurora,This piece of ice feels warmer than others.
129,Krystal,"Oooh, is this some sort of Crystal too…it's freezing my fingers off!!"
130,Izanami,Chaos… Chaos! It was Chaos that ruined me!
131,Maia,"Hey, what do you think you're doing? The Great Maia will not be intimidated by mere mortals!"
132,Aurora,"Good day, I'm searching for any biographies of knights that this library may hold."
133,Librarian,"Of course, I think we have some over on that shelf. Give me a moment to locate them for you."
134,Succuba,"Oh Muppet, when was the last time we've met since Saint tore you away from me?"
135,Muppet,Saint… where are you… please save me again…
136,Nobunaga,"Estel, what are you hiding in your backpack?"
137,Estel,"H-hey! They're just some harmless fireworks, not bombs!"
138,Lord Dracula,Which asinine Vampire decided that Matcha-flavored blood is a good idea?
139,Dracula,"Y-yeah, I totally agree, haha…"
140,Raphael,"Hello, Hermes. I'd like to order some herbs from your Store; the need for them has arisen drastically."
141,Hermes,Of course! It's always a pleasure to do business with you.
142,Scythe,"Now, now, what do we have here? A ghost in the living world, refusing to head to her afterlife!"
143,Wraith,Don't look at me… keep your distance...
144,Frexie,"Heh heh heh, time for my ultimate prank…wait, where are my bag of prank toys?"
145,Gwen & Brigit,Gwen: Finally. \nBrigit: Took her long enough to find out~
146,Izanami,Have you seen my lover…?
147,Diana,I'm afraid I haven't. Have you been separated from a loved one too? Don't give up on them; I hope you will be reunited soon.
148,Psychic,"Woah, a penguin! You don't see much of them in these parts. How do you take care of it?"
149,Sivney,"Who, Bonnie? She's self-sufficient and can take care of herself."
150,Sakura,"The cherry blossoms are breathtaking, even as they pass away…"
151,Estel,No!! I don't want you to die!!
152,Sakura,"Death is inevitable, Estel."
153,Vivian,The stars say that I will be lucky today~
154,Aquaris,What about me? What about me?
155,Diana,"Apollis, my dear sister…"
156,Vivian,"Don't worry. The Stars foretold that you will be reunited with her very soon, didn't they?"
157,Hermes,Up for a drink?
158,Teresa,Tonight?
159,Hermes,Sure. That new bar?
160,Blair,Whoever makes a move on Senpai…will face the consequences.
161,Gambler,Sounds ominous.
162,Aurora,Winter is the purest season of all.
163,Bud Elf,Why do you like winters so much? My plants suffer in the winter!
164,Aquaris,"Hey, Monica! Can you tell me what happens to me in the future?"
165,Monica,…I don't think so.
166,Hottie,I feel so alone in the Dorms…
167,Raphael,"…No matter what you do, just don't mentally scar the students again, please?"
168,Hermes,"Kassy, your daggers are incredibly stylish! Do you think it will be popular if I mass-produced daggers like yours?"
169,Kassy,Don't touch my weapons. I will not take responsibility if you accidentally hurt yourself.
170,Jelly,I wonder if the sea has changed since I left for the land.
171,Himoto,Who cares about the sea? The land is way more fun!
172,Mio,Meow!
173,Kassy,Hm? What do you want?
174,Mio,Good luck meow-ny…I want some…
175,Zoe,"You're injured! Here, I'll patch you up."
176,Fenrir,"It's just a scratch, stop fussing over nothing."
177,Blair,Senpai~Senpai~Where are you~
178,Frexie,"You're acting super creepy now, Blair."
179,Blair,"Creepy? I'll show you creepy, brat."
