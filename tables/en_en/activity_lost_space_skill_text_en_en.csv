1,Sweep Laser,32,activity_lost_space_icon_skill2,Guide the Laser to explore the blocks of area in the same row as the last block explored.
2,Cross Laser,42,activity_lost_space_icon_skill1,"Guide the Laser to explore (maximum) 8 blocks next to the last explored block (top, bottom, left, and right 2 each)."
3,Charged Laser,52,activity_lost_space_icon_skill3,Guide the Laser to explore (maximum) 6 blocks next to the last explored block (top and bottom 3 each). The amount of laser energies required to trigger this skill will be reduced by 6 each time the skill is triggered (maximum by 18). ({1} reduction(s) made)
4,Circle Laser,43,activity_lost_space_icon_skill4,Guide the Laser to explore the blocks of area neighboring the last block explored.
5,Unstable Laser,38,activity_lost_space_icon_skill5,Guide the Laser to explore 5 random blocks of area. (Unexplored area will be explored first)
6,Adaptive Laser,34,activity_lost_space_icon_skill6,"Guide the Laser to explore 2 blocks next to the last explored block (top and bottom). The exploration range will be increased by 1 block of area (1 more block for top or bottom by turns, the exploration range on top will be increased first) each time the skill is triggered. (maximum by 4 blocks of area) ({1} block(s) increased)"
