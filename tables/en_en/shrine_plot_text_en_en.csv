1,Prologue,,Rumors of the Tsuruga Grand Shrine traveled far and wide across the land.,
2,,,"Word goes that a God laid down the foundations for the trial grounds there, and whoever had the skills (or luck) to pass the trials will be rewarded with precious artifacts, crafted by the Gods themselves.",
3,,*,"Every minute of careful planning leads up to this moment! Tsuruga Grand Shrine, be prepared for the greatness that is me!",
4,,,A Shrine Maiden paused sweeping and glared at me.,
5,,Shrine Maiden,"Ugh, outsiders who have no respect for the trials nor for the Shrine, undermining the danger with eyes only on the ultimate prize. Do you mind moving a bit? I'm trying to sweep here.",
6,,*,"Oops, moving now. Though I have to assure you, I am confident that my team and I will pass the fabled trials!",
7,,Shrine Maiden,"I've heard this spoken countless times. Few actually followed through. Anyways, I should be getting back to my duties, so good luck out there.",
8,,*,"Aww, that's so nice of you, Miss. If you are also in the mood to impart wisdom on how to clear the trials, I'd be all ears.",
9,,Shrine Maiden,The only advice I will be giving you today is to go home. You'd at least leave with all your limbs intact.,
10,,*,"Nope, that's not an option. So, since helpful words are out of the picture, maybe some helpful charms and talismans...?",
11,,Shrine Maiden,"Even if there was one, it's bold of you to assume that I'd be handing them out freely. Since you have already made up your mind, then there's nothing I can say or do to help. As I said before, good luck.",
12,,Shrine Maiden,"...If Chizuko was here, she would have tried her best to convince you to leave. But she doesn't understand that bullheaded folks like you just won't change your minds like that...",
13,,*,"Thank you! By the way, who's this Chizuko person you're talking about...?",
14,,Shrine Maiden,"Don't even think about it. Chizuko is kind, adorable, and way out of your league.",
15,,*,She sounds nice and friendly! I will definitely try to befriend her after I pass the trials.,
16,,Shrine Maiden,"Ugh, you're hopeless. Now scram and stop getting in the way.",
17,,*,"See you later! ...Treasure, treasure, here I come~",
18,New Friends?,*,"I'm tired. Exhausted. This patch of ground is nice and comfortable, and I don't want to move.",
19,,Uriel,"Well done, Senpai! We have gathered a bunch of Origami Cranes. This should be enough for a reward from the Pond of Prayers.",
20,,*,"Ooh, a reward! I suddenly feel much more motivated to get up now. Goodbye, comfortable patch of earth.",
21,,,A very familiar Shrine Maiden swept her broom over my feet. Rude.,
22,,Shrine Maiden,"Ugh, you again...is this the ""team"" you mentioned last time?",
23,,Uriel,"Good day, Miss. My name is Uriel.",
24,,*,"I'm so glad to see you again! As you may have guessed, I passed the trials! With all my limbs intact, no less!",
25,,*,"Look, I even got the Origami Cranes to prove it!",
26,,Shrine Maiden,"Hmph, those are authentic ""Symbols of Approval"". I'm surprised that you actually passed the trials. Or did this lady do all the work for you?",
27,,Uriel,"Oh no, I can't take all the credit. Senpai pulled his weight in the trial.",
28,,*,"Hear, hear!",
29,,Shrine Maiden,Good.\nWhy are you standing in the way? The Pond of Prayers is that way.,
30,,*,"My bad, my bad.",
31,,*,"I'm *, by the way. Do you mind telling me your name? I can't always call you ""Miss"", and we're probably going to see each other again.",
32,,Mami,...It's Mami.,
33,,Mami,……,
34,,Mami,...Do you need anything else?,
35,,KongMing,"Senpai, Uriel.",
36,,KongMing,"Instead of clearing the trials and collecting treasure for the Academy like the others, I have a different mission for you. Multiple missions, to be exact.",
37,,Ithil,"*, aside from passing the trials, you will be infiltrating the Shrine, befriending the Shrine Maidens and Priestesses.",
38,,Ithil,"When you have done so, you will try your best to uncover the secrets of the Shrine, especially the source of the treasures.",
39,,KongMing,"The treasures are effective when fighting against Chaos, and any information about them would benefit us greatly.",
40,,KongMing,"Uriel, you are in charge of Senpai's safety. Shady characters have been reported to visit the Shrine, and asking around may draw unwanted attention to Senpai.",
41,,Uriel,I swear on my Shield and my honor as a Knight that I will not allow any harm to befall Senpai.,
42,,*,"Knowledge, maybe? I'd like to learn more about your Shrine.",
43,,*,"The God that this Shrine is dedicated to, the origins of the trials, the history of the treasures, that sort of thing. Since you work here, you must know a lot about this Shrine, right? Please?",
44,,Mami,"Huh, that's new.",
45,,Mami,Most just take the treasure and leave. Not many people want to learn about our Shrine.,
46,,*,"Yes, that's me, always eager to learn! So please? Pretty please? With cherries and ice cream and marshmallows on top?",
47,,Mami,I'm starting to think you are looking for diabetes instead of knowledge.,
48,,*,"Aww, you shouldn't insult my eating habits before you try it yourself. I know this really good cake place...",
49,,Mami,"Thanks, but no thanks.",
50,,Mami,"I'm not an expert in story-telling, so you're barking up the wrong tree if it truly is knowledge that you're seeking.",
51,,Mami,"Visit the Shrine Office at nightfall: Ms. Mizue will be recounting the history of the Shrine, as well as past legends to the younger Shrine Maidens. They wouldn't mind anyone joining them.",
52,,Mami,"However, don't even think about disturbing them, or I will hunt you down personally and murder you with this broom. Are we clear?",
53,,*,"Aww, you wound me with your suspicions.",
54,,Mami,It's always beneficial to be cautious. Who knows what shady businesses you outsiders are up to?,
55,,Mami,"Now, if you will excuse me, I need to get back to sweeping.",
56,,*,...(Puppy eyes),
57,,Mami,...What.,
58,,*,"You mentioned a girl named Chizuko last time, right?",
59,,Mami,？！,
60,,*,"Do you think I can meet her? I mean, a friend of yours is a friend of mine! Right?",
61,,Mami,Get. Out.,
62,Story Night,Uriel,"Senpai, what happened? You were so hyper before, and now you're just…wallowing in misery.",
63,,*,"Nothing big, just a bit miffed that Mami doesn't seem to trust me. Especially after everything we've been through together!",
64,,Uriel,"...You've had a grand total of two conversations with her, Senpai. I think you should give her more time.",
65,,*,"You're right, she must be taken aback by my overflowing friendliness. She probably needs more time to get used to me. Hey, is that the Shrine Office up ahead?",
66,,,Not too far away young Shrine Maidens can be seen sitting on stools and listening attentively to an elderly Priestess.,
67,,Uriel,"Looks like we're just in time. Unfortunately, all seats are taken, so we must stand for the entirety of the session.",
68,,？？？,(Pushes two spare stools forward),
69,,*,"Thank you, dearie.",
70,,？？？,……,
71,,Uriel,She seems like a shy kid.,
72,,*,"Well, yet another mystery to the mix. Let's just listen to what Ms. Mizue has to say first so we can bring some information back to KongMing and Ithil.",
73,,Mizue,"Now, can anyone tell me what did we cover last time?",
74,,？？？,"(Raises hand) You said that the land upon which our Shrine is built used to be wide, fertile plains, and that crops grew without being cultivated!",
75,,Mizue,"Excellent! Well done, Chizuko.",
76,,Chizuko,Hurray!,
77,,*,"(Ah, this must be the Chizuko girl Mami mentioned. She is as adorable as I imagined.)",
78,,Mizue,"Before the Tsuruga Grand Shrine was established, this region was called Sawagi, meaning ""moist and plentiful lands"".",
79,,Mizue,"Sawagi, as Chizuko mentioned, was a wide and fertile terrain. Trees bore fruit overnight, and its habitants never worried about starving.",
80,,Mizue,Everything changed when two monsters arrived.,
81,,Mizue,"They were brothers: the older brother was named Ao Oni, while the younger brother called itself Aka Oni. Ao Oni drew in rain clouds and flooded rivers and lakes when it cried; Aka Oni brought about droughts when it laughed.",
82,,Mizue,"They came from the Tsuyuoka region, where they caused mischief.",
83,,Mizue,"The people of Tsuyuoka had the ability to communicate with Gods. When the brothers were too much to bear with, they plead to the Gods to stop the brothers.",
84,,Mizue,"The Gods heard the prayers. They descended to the mortal world and beheaded the brothers. However, they were no ordinary monsters and could survive even with their heads separated from their bodies.",
85,,Mizue,The brothers fled Tsuyuoka with their heads when the Gods were taken unawares.,
86,,Mizue,"Ao Oni and Aka Oni traveled across the world, suffering from hunger and the cold in search of another place to settle down. When they reached Sawagi, they were bitter about what they have experienced and were jealous of the Sawagi people who lived happy and carefree lives.",
87,,Mizue,"They robbed the people, moving into the most luxurious house in the region, and will only be appeased with annual offerings of treasure, food, and a young girl. Unlike the people of Tsuyuoka, the people of Sawagi couldn't communicate with the Gods, and any efforts to rebel against their oppression were met with a swift and bloody end. They had no choice but to comply with the brothers' requests.",
88,,Mizue,"The two monsters thrived with the yearly offerings. The sacrifice was killed in cold blood, and huge bonfires were raised to burn the body.",
89,,Mizue,"Much to Aka Oni's displeasure, the people of Sawagi didn't fall into poverty as it expected, thanks to the fertile soil of the region.",
90,,Mizue,"It wanted them to suffer as itself and its brother did on the travels, so it started to laugh every day, bringing droughts to the land.",
91,,Mizue,"The soil gradually became barren as Aka Oni's laughs boomed across the land on a daily basis, and crops stopped growing despite the best efforts of the Sawagi people.",
92,,Mizue,"The yearly demands of food became impossible to fulfill, but Aka Oni showed no mercy. It tortured the people when it didn't get what it wanted.",
93,,Mizue,Aka Oni finally achieved its dreams of seeing the inhabitants of Sawagi suffer as it did.,
94,,Mizue,"When all seemed bleak, Enbi no Mikoto, a brave young woman and our savior, decided to stand against Aka Oni and end its ""rule"".",
95,,Mizue,"She wanted Sawagi to return to what it was before the brothers arrived and reasoned that the only way to achieve this was to slay Aka Oni, who brought about all the droughts.",
96,,Mizue,...And that's all for today. You will learn more about Enbi no Mikoto and what she did tomorrow.,
97,,Uriel,"I wonder whether Enbi no Mikoto succeeded in killing the monster. Since she is called ""the Savior"", then she probably did.",
98,,*,"It's likely. Or maybe she failed, but her sacrifice urged the Sawagi people to rebel against the brothers, like a symbol.",
99,,Uriel,I hope not. It's not a befitting ending for someone like her.,
100,,Uriel,"The sun should shine bright in the sky, not dragged down to the depths of the underworld.",
101,,*,Who knows? It's all speculation at this point.,
102,,*,"We should come back tomorrow; I'd like to learn something about the Pond of Prayers, and you can find out what happened to Enbi no Mikoto.",
103,Crossing Paths,Chizuko,(Hums a merry tune),
104,,Uriel,She looks familiar.,
105,,*,"Wait, I think I know who she is...you're Chizuko, right?",
106,,Chizuko,"Oh, yes! But why do you know my name?",
107,,*,"I'm *, and this is Uriel. We were there yesterday at Ms. Mizue's lecture.",
108,,*,"And I've chatted with Mami, who says that you're kind and adorable.",
109,,Chizuko,"Oooh, really?",
110,,Chizuko,"I don't know I should be mortified that she talks about me to total strangers, or be delighted that she does.",
111,,*,"I'd go with delighted. I mean, she surely thinks highly of you.",
112,,*,"I can't say the same for myself though, seeing how she always looks irritated when I'm around.",
113,,Chizuko,"Yes, that sounds like Mami. She's very protective of us, you see. There was an incident where an outsider tried to kidnap a Shrine Maiden for the secrets of our Shrine.",
114,,Chizuko,"Thankfully, Mami chased him out before he succeeded, or we would be in great trouble. She's been wary of outsiders ever since.",
115,,Chizuko,At least she hasn't chased you out with her broom yet. I think that means you're okay in her books.,
116,,*,(But she treats me like dirt...literally. With her sweeping broom.),
117,,Chizuko,"I'm still a Shrine-Maiden-in-training for now, but I want to be like Mami in the future.",
118,,Chizuko,"She is warm, caring, skillful, and just the best big sister anyone can ask for!",
119,,Uriel,"Speaking of this, I'm wondering why the Shrine allowed the rumors to spread.",
120,,Uriel,Wouldn't it be a lot safer for you without having to deal with the Outsiders coming and going every day for the treasure?,
121,,Chizuko,I don't think we can stop the rumors even if we wanted to; everyone must have heard of them by now!,
122,,Chizuko,"Besides, our Senior Priestess said that it is vital to have outsiders participating in the trials instead of just us Shrine Maidens.",
123,,Chizuko,"Seeing how the trials are...you know what, you should join us again tonight. I'm sure Ms. Mizue will cover this in her narration.",
124,,*,Not even a spoiler?,
125,,Chizuko,Nope! You don't see people who are actually interested in the Shrine every day. Most are just here for the trial and the treasure.,
126,,Chizuko,"Us Shrine Maidens are responsible for passing down knowledge and traditions, so that's what I'm doing!",
127,,Uriel,Of course. We still haven't found out whether Enbi no Mikoto managed to defeat the Aka Oni or not.,
128,,Chizuko,"As I said, no spoilers!",
129,,Chizuko,"Enbi no Mikoto is one of the people that I admire a lot, and I like her legend a lot. I can't ruin the experience of hearing her tale for you.",
130,,Chizuko,"Oops, duty calls. See you later~",
131,,*,"Judging from her tone, I think Enbi no Mikoto succeeded, or else she wouldn't be so enthusiastic.",
132,,Uriel,I sure hope so.,
133,,*,It's time for us to head back to the trials anyway; we need to gather more Origami Cranes to exchange treasure with.,
134,,*,"Or should I say ""Symbols of Approval""? That's what Mami called them, right?",
135,,,……,
136,,？？？,"Too much time has passed since I've left. What do they call this place now...Sawagi? No, no, it's Tsuruga, the name of the Shrine.",
137,,？？？,"Too many demons lurk in the shadows, too much pain and despair threaten to consume me wherever I went, so I fled...",
138,,？？？,"But now everything has changed, and the Tsuruga Grand Shrine is only a shadow of its former glory.",
139,,？？？,"If we haven't hesitated that night and sought refuge in the Shrine…we would have changed our fates, wouldn't we?",
140,,Izanami,"I wouldn't have been infected by Chaos, and you would never have left me behind…",
141,,Izanami,"Where are you now, Izanagi?",
142,,Izanami,Have you ever returned to this land that we once called home?,
143,,Uriel,Senpai?,
144,,*,I think I saw someone familiar...but she was gone when I blinked.,
145,,Uriel,Perhaps another student from the Academy? We're not the only ones KongMing and Ithil sent.,
146,,*,"I'm not sure...maybe I'm just imagining things. Anyways, we have a trial to clear. Let's do that.",
147,Story Night…Again,Uriel,"Senpai, Senpai, over here! Ms. Mizue is just about to start!",
148,,*,"Coming! You are really invested in this story now, Uriel.",
149,,Uriel,I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep soundly without knowing the end of this tale.,
150,,Uriel,I wonder if Chizuko made it... I can't find her with everyone wearing the same Shrine Maiden uniforms.,
151,,Mizue,"... Enbi no Mikoto, who decided to rebel against Aka Oni, donned a red dress and hid a sharpened machete among its folds.",
152,,Mizue,She pretended to yield to the two brothers and was taken into their residence as a servant.,
153,,Mizue,"Aka Oni and Ao Oni were satisfied with her service and gradually trusted her with more household chores, granting her access to their private space whenever she saw fit.",
154,,Mizue,"During this time, she read about the origins of the two brothers in their library.",
155,,Mizue,"She also found a painting stuck to a scarecrow that the brothers often beat up in anger. While she didn't understand its significance, she memorized every detail of the painting.",
156,,Mizue,"One night, when Aka Oni was fast asleep, Enbi no Mikoto grasped her trusty machete and entered its quarters.",
157,,Mizue,"In one firm slash, Aka Oni's head was separated from its body.",
158,,Mizue,"Enbi no Mikoto turned to leave immediately but stopped in her tracks as she remembered the scars on the necks of the brothers, as well as the fact that despite being beheaded by the Gods before, they still lived.",
159,,Mizue,"Before leaving the room, she set the scarecrow's head on the decapitated body of Aka Oni, covered it with a thick quilt, and hid Aka Oni's head in the folds of her dress.",
160,,Mizue,"Ao Oni, who was out earlier that night, saw her exit Aka Oni's room. It asked: ""Was your dress always this red?""",
161,,Mizue,"Enbi no Mikoto feigned calmness: ""Yes, I've always worn a red dress.""",
162,,Mizue,Ao Oni didn't notice any evidence of foul play under the dim lights of the night and allowed Enbi no Mikoto to leave with its brother's head.,
163,,Uriel,Yesssss!,
164,,,"Everyone turned to Uriel, who shouted in triumph.",
165,,*,(Whispers) Shush! You're interrupting the story.,
166,,Uriel,I apologize for the disruption.,
167,,Chizuko,(Yells) YESSSSS!,
168,,,"Another yell, this time from Chizuko, drew attention to herself.",
169,,*,"Huh, Chizuko shouted too. At least you're not the only one now.",
170,,Chizuko,Enbi no Mikoto escaped unscathed after slaying the horrendous monster. This is my favorite part of the story!,
171,,Mizue,I know. Your excitement when we arrive at this point of the story sure hasn't dimmed a bit despite how many times you have heard it.,
172,,Mizue,"While it is nice to express your adoration of Enbi no Mikoto verbally, it is stopping me from proceeding with the tale.",
173,,Chizuko,"Whoops. This won't happen again, I promise! I'll shout quietly next time! In my mind!",
174,,Uriel,(Whispers) Me too. This won't happen again.,
175,,Mizue,"... As I was saying, Enbi no Mikoto left the brothers' residence with Aka Oni's head. The people of Sawagi were overjoyed at the announcement that the menace was gone for good.",
176,,Mizue,"Together, they burned Aka Oni's head to ashes, believing that the much-loathed droughts will not harm Sawagi again.",
177,,Mizue,"As Ao Oni didn't share Aka Oni's enthusiasm in torturing the people of Sawagi, they didn't suffer as much with Aka Oni out of the picture.",
178,,Mizue,"Although life in Sawagi was still a far cry from what it was, the people were content with what they managed to achieve.",
179,,Mizue,"During this time, Ao Oni believed that Aka Oni was simply asleep from exhaustion. However, it grew worried when its brother never woke up.",
180,,Mizue,"It flung the quilt off Aka Oni's bed, prepared to ask why Aka Oni was resting for such a long time, but the question died on its tongue as it saw its brother's beheaded body. All that remained in the place of the head was a bunch of hay.",
181,,Mizue,"Ao Oni rushed out of the room. As the brothers were connected by blood, it was able to locate Aka Oni's head with their link. Much to its dismay, it was led to a pile of ashes, indicating Aka Oni's fate.",
182,,Mizue,"While they were immortal, regenerating their bodies will take months, even years.",
183,,Mizue,"Ao Oni sobbed uncontrollably as it realized that it will be parted with its brother for a long, long time.",
184,,Mizue,"Ao Oni's tears drew in heavy rain clouds, and Sawagi suffered from the downpour that ensued.",
185,,Mizue,"The rivers overflowed, submerging the farmlands in floodwaters and robbing them of the ability to grow crops. What's worse, the floodwaters brought about pests and plague as well.",
186,,Mizue,"The Sawagi people, who had just started to settle down again, started to panic, and plead Ao Oni to spare them.",
187,,Mizue,Ao Oni promised to cease the endless rain in exchange for the murderer of its brother.,
188,,Mizue,They did not hesitate to sell Enbi no Mikoto out and delivered her to the hands of Ao Oni to appease it.,
189,,Mizue,... And that's all for today. We'll delve further into the story and into the fate of Enbi no Mikoto tomorrow. I'd be glad to see you join us tomorrow too.,
190,,*,"Thank you, we'd be honored to.",
191,,*,"I can't believe the nerve of these people, turning their backs to Enbi no Mikoto like that. Don't you agree, Uriel... Uriel?",
192,,Uriel,This... this isn't right...,
193,Cranes,Uriel,……,
194,,Chizuko,……,
195,,*,Are you okay? Your eyes are swollen and puffy.,
196,,Chizuko,It's just... I couldn't get the story out of my head and cried myself to sleep last night.,
197,,Uriel,I feel the same.,
198,,*,"I thought you knew what happened to Enbi no Mikoto, Chizuko.",
199,,Chizuko,I do! It's just hard to not be saddened by this part of the story despite having heard it recited countless times…but I probably should pull myself together in front of guests. (Takes several deep breaths),
200,,Chizuko,"... Whew! There, a lot better!",
201,,Chizuko,"So, will the both of you be joining us again tonight?",
202,,Uriel,"Of course! I have faith in Enbi no Mikoto; a strong woman like her wouldn't be stopped by hardships like this one, despite how daunting it seems.",
203,,Chizuko,"Hmm... I'd hate to spoil the experience of hearing this story for the first time,",
204,,Chizuko,"but I can assure you that no, this is not the end of her story.",
205,,Chizuko,I think we will reach the climax of the story today. I can't wait!,
206,,*,That's good to hear. Uriel can finally stop being so nervous and fidgety.,
207,,Uriel,Senpai! (Blushes),
208,,Chizuko,"By the way, where did you come from? I keep forgetting to ask...",
209,,*,"We're from Yume Academy, and I'm her Senpai. Well, I'm the Senpai of almost everyone in the Academy.",
210,,Chizuko,Yume Academy? Is it far away from here?,
211,,Uriel,It's located south of the Wastelands of Foehn.,
212,,Chizuko,The Wastelands of Foehn... I think I read about it before. And you're from further away than that? Wow!,
213,,*,It would have taken us forever to arrive here if the Academy didn't provide us with some high-tech vehicles.,
214,,Chizuko,Oh! Have you seen cranes on your way here? I've never seen one before!,
215,,Uriel,"Cranes? As in, the bird?",
216,,Chizuko,"Yes! In fact, the Tsuruga Grand Shrine is named after the cranes! Well, the word for crane in the local tongue, that is.",
217,,*,"I don't understand... if the shrine is named after them, then shouldn't they be fairly ordinary here?",
218,,Chizuko,"Nope! We don't have cranes here. They are mythical creatures, you see, that only appear when the Gods descend to earth. According to legends, they are servants of God.",
219,,Chizuko,"We've only seen paintings depicting them, but never in real life. Many of us believed that they only exist in stories and tales.",
220,,Chizuko,"It isn't until we heard outsiders talking about them that we knew that they are real, living creatures.",
221,,Uriel,"Well, that's not the case from where we came from. While they aren't too common, some can be found if you're in the right place at the right time. As a matter of fact, I've seen some from afar before.",
222,,Chizuko,Woah! Do they really have black and white feathers with a streak of red on their heads? Do they look as elegant as the ancient scrolls say?,
223,,*,"I've never read your scrolls, so I'm not sure about the elegant part, but yes, that sounds like the cranes I've seen.",
224,,Chizuko,"Just as the scrolls and tomes said! Cranes must have lived in the region before, or our predecessors wouldn't have drawn them this accurately.",
225,,Chizuko,"I hope I can see one myself one day! Did I tell you that one of my dreams is touching the feathers of a crane? I'm named after them, you see, and they're my favorite!",
226,,,"Chizuko was brimming with excitement at learning more about cranes when a passerby crashed into her, causing her to fall to the ground with a yelp.",
227,,？？？,"Tch. Get out of my way, brat.",
228,,Uriel,How rude! Come back here and apologize to Chizuko!,
229,,*,"(I have a bad feeling about that person, but... I should help Chizuko now. This can wait.)",
230,,*,"Are you alright, Chizuko? Here, I'll help you up.",
231,,Chizuko,"Thank you! I'm just taken unawares. Look, not even a scratch!",
232,,Uriel,I memorized what he wore. I can drag him back here so he can apologize properly.,
233,,Chizuko,"Oh no, you don't have to do that! I'm glad that you care, but I think it's partially my fault too; I wasn't paying attention to my surroundings.",
234,,Chizuko,"Besides, he's gone for a while and he was wearing the uniform of his team. I don't think we can catch up to him or single him out from his team.",
235,,？？？,"I heard the commotion. What happened, Chizuko?",
236,,Chizuko,"Senior Priestess Kugatsu! Someone ran into me, and my friends here want them to apologize properly, that's all.",
237,,Senior Priestess,(Shakes head) These outsiders are getting out of line. I'll send them a warning.,
238,,Senior Priestess,And you are?,
239,,*,"Hello! I am *, and this is Uriel.",
240,,Kugatsu,"Good day. I am Kugatsu, Senior Priestess of the Tsuruga Grand Shrine.",
241,,Chizuko,"Senior Priestess, * and Uriel weren't trying to disrupt the order or mean harm to the shrine. I can vouch for them!",
242,,Kugatsu,"Don't worry, I'm not here to harass your friends.",
243,,Kugatsu,"Although if memory serves me right, you are supposed to be helping with preparing the ceremony.",
244,,Chizuko,"Whoops, it's time to get back to work already? I'll start right away, Senior Priestess.",
245,(Yet Another) Story Night,Mizue,"... Enbi no Mikoto was betrayed by the Sawagi people, who handed her over to Ao Oni to appease its anger.",
246,,Mizue,"As Aka Oni's head was burnt to ashes, Ao Oni wanted Enbi no Mikoto to suffer the same fate. It built a large pyre to ensure Enbi no Mikoto will not survive.",
247,,Mizue,"Their foul deed did not change Enbi no Mikoto's devotion of protecting the people, so she walked willingly to the blazing fires.",
248,,Mizue,"As she gazed at the flames, she was reminded of the painting that the brothers seemed to be averse to.",
249,,,"All the other Shrine Maidens, including Chizuko, joined Ms. Mizue in reciting the story.",
250,,Shrine Maidens,Enbi no Mikoto had a revelation regarding the scene on the painting: it was an ancient and primal memory of the ancestors of Sawagi.,
251,,Shrine Maidens,"The painting depicted figures of dancers amid the tendrils of fire. Following their stances, Enbi no Mikoto started to dance as well.",
252,,Shrine Maidens,It was close to impossible to tell that this was her first time going through this routine; the moves were smooth and graceful as she twisted and twirled unscathed in the flames meant to harm her.,
253,,Shrine Maidens,"All of a sudden, the sounds of birds flapping their wings could be heard, and a flock of black, white, and red birds appeared on the horizon.",
254,,Shrine Maidens,"They were cranes, and the flapping of their wings dispersed the rainclouds that Ao Oni summoned.",
255,,Shrine Maidens,"Homura-Ōmikami, the God watching over us all, sat among the cranes and rescued Enbi no Mikoto from the fire.",
256,,Shrine Maidens,"The people of Sawagi raised their heads in wonder, watching the first God to ever descend to the Sawagi lands, cradling Enbi no Mikoto in Their arms.",
257,,Shrine Maidens,The dance of Enbi no Mikoto gradually became the practice we call Kagura dance today.,
258,,Mizue,"Well, it's good to know that you haven't forgotten your heritage.",
259,,*,(Whispers) Just how many times have they heard this story to have it memorized down to every word??,
260,,Mizue,"Ao Oni was beyond frightened when Enbi no Mikoto began to dance, and rushed towards the ignited pyre.",
261,,Mizue,"Much to its astonishment, the flames intending to take Enbi no Mikoto's life stopped its steps, and it couldn't get close to the dancing girl.",
262,,Mizue,"Ao Oni forced itself to shed tears, summoning more rainclouds, but the rain failed to put out the fires.",
263,,Mizue,"It had no choice but to wait for Enbi no Mikoto to finish her dance, sealing its fate by summoning Homura-Ōmikami.",
264,,Mizue,"The battle between Homura-Ōmikami and Ao Oni lasted for seven days and seven nights. While Ao Oni had no power against Homura-Ōmikami, it had regeneration powers and fled whenever it could.",
265,,Mizue,"In the end, Homura-Ōmikami called upon the powers of the sun, and Ao Oni was reduced to ashes.",
266,,Mizue,"Unfortunately, Ao Oni's death didn't restore the ruined lands of Sawagi, where no crops could ever grow again.",
267,,Mizue,The Sawagi people prayed to Homura-Ōmikami to make the earth fertile again for the crops to grow. Enbi no Mikoto prayed as well.,
268,,Mizue,"Moved by Enbi no Mikoto's pleas, Homura-Ōmikami ordered the cranes to fly across Sawagi, bringing life back to the land.",
269,,Mizue,"However, the deeds of the Sawagi people couldn't go unpunished.",
270,,Mizue,"The farmlands of Sawagi never returned to their former fertility, and the people had to work diligently to feed themselves.",
271,,Mizue,"Before Homura-Ōmikami returned to the heavens, They ordered Enbi no Mikoto to build a shrine for Them.",
272,,Mizue,"Enbi no Mikoto named the shrine Tsuruga, after the cranes that were servants of the Deity.",
273,,Mizue,... And this is how the Tsuruga Grand Shrine came into being.,
274,,Uriel,Whew! I'm glad that everything turned out okay for Enbi no Mikoto.,
275,,*,"To be honest, I was expecting to learn more about the trials.",
276,,Uriel,Now that you mention it...,
277,,,Ms. Mizue walked towards us as if she had overheard our conversation.,
278,,Mizue,"Homura-Ōmikami may have defeated Ao Oni, but the brothers were immortal, and the danger still existed.",
279,,Mizue,Come back again tomorrow; the story is far from over yet.,
280,,*,We will.,
281,,,……,
282,,Izanami,"We used to walk under the moonlight, holding hands all the while... but you're not here now, Izanagi.",
283,,Izanami,There was no trace of you ever having returned; why did you stay away? Have you forgotten all about me? About us?,
284,,Izanami,"I will find you, Izanagi... No matter where you have gone.",
285,,Athena,Izanami!,
286,,Izanami,... Athena. This better be important.,
287,,Athena,I have a message from Kratos. She heard that Yume Academy sent students here to the Tsuruga Grand Shrine. Since you're already here...,
288,,Izanami,I am only here to seek Izanagi. This was our homeland; I will not taint the fond memories I have of this place.,
289,,Athena,But Kratos ordered...,
290,,Izanami,Enough. Just tell her what I said. I am not obliged to follow her orders.,
291,,Izanami,"For your safety, I would suggest not taking any rash actions when you're in the Shrine. It is not unguarded.",
292,,Athena,... As you wish. I have another report to make: I discovered traces of Chaos activity here. I suspect it has already infiltrated the shrine.,
293,,Izanami,Chaos!,
294,,Izanami,I understand. If the Chaos have the misfortune of running into me... I will end them.,
295,,Izanami,"... I hear footsteps. We will be getting company soon. If there are no more reports, I will be taking my leave.",
296,,Athena,"That was the last. I wish you well, Izanami.",
297,,*,……？,
298,,Uriel,What will happen next? I hope Enbi no Mikoto lived happily ever after in the end.,
299,,Uriel,... Senpai? Senpai? Have you been listening to anything I said in the last minute?,
300,,*,"I'm sorry, Uriel, but I swear I saw the same person several days ago. I can't seem to remember her identity though.",
301,Names,Chizuko,"*, over here~",
302,,Chizuko,What brings you here today? And where's Uriel?,
303,,*,"Ah, she's still asleep. Apparently, she was up all night being excited for Enbi no Mikoto and only fell asleep at sunrise, so it's just me today. What are you doing?",
304,,Chizuko,We're preparing for the Ceremony! It will be held at night three days later. Will you be there?,
305,,*,I wouldn't miss it for anything! I'll tell Uriel about this too. What happens at this Ceremony?,
306,,Chizuko,"It's a huge event! It's more like a Festival, now that I think about it: Food Stalls, Game Stalls... And we would also be having a Kagura Dance Performance!",
307,,Chizuko,"Us Shrine Maidens tried to follow the historical texts as best as possible, but it's probably not the same routine that Enbi no Mikoto went through. I can guarantee you that it's still amazing though!",
308,,Chizuko,"I've always wanted to perform, but I can't since I'm not an official Shrine Maiden yet. That, and I need a lot more practice before I'm deemed worthy!",
309,,*,I'm sure you will be able to sometime soon. I can't wait to see you on stage!,
310,,Chizuko,"Thank you! By the way, you said you know Mami, right? Look, there she is!",
311,,,"As I turned towards the direction Chizuko was gesturing to, I saw Mami, Ms. Mizue, Senior Priestess Kugatsu, and the young shrine maiden who saved us seats during the lecture.",
312,,,"Suddenly, my eyes met with Mami's cautious ones. Her expression soured.",
313,,*,"Oh no, Mami wouldn't be happy with me for befriending Chizuko...",
314,,Mami,"Chizuko, what are you doing with this imbecile?",
315,,*,"Ouch, you didn't have to be so harsh!",
316,,Chizuko,"Hm? Aren't you friends with *, Mami?",
317,,Mami,"Ugh, no. What nonsense have you been filling Chizuko's head with?",
318,,Mizue,"Mamiko, you should be kinder to your friends.",
319,,？？？,"Ms. Mizue, her name is Mami, not Mamiko.",
320,,Mizue,Keiko? What did you just say? What about Mamiko?,
321,,Keiko,"I said, her name is Mami, not Mamiko!",
322,,Mizue,"Oh yes, Mami, Mami, that's her name. Old age has chipped away at my hearing, I'm afraid.",
323,,*,"Mamiko? Sounds like a cute name, and makes you and Chizuko seem more like sisters-Ouch!",
324,,Keiko,(Headbutts *) NOT MAMIKO! MAMI!,
325,,Mami,"Good job, Keiko! And Ms. Mizue...I am by no means friends with this outsider.",
326,,Kugatsu,"And you probably shouldn't be. We shouldn't be too trusting of outsiders, Ms. Mizue.",
327,,Mizue,"Haha, you worry too much, Kugatsu. Old age has done a number on my hearing, but not on my sight nor my judge of character: I can see that this youngster here is good at heart.",
328,,Kugatsu,"...If you say so, Ms. Mizue.",
329,,*,"Aww, I'm so touched, Ms. Mizue! By the way, why does Senior Priestess Kugatsu treat Ms. Mizue so respectfully? I thought she was the leader of this Shrine?",
330,,Mami,"Ms. Mizue is the Head Priestess of Tsuruga Grand Shrine. While Senior Priestess Kugatsu manages most worldly matters now, all of us respect Ms. Mizue very much.",
331,,*,"I can see that, since your attitude towards me softened remarkably when Ms. Mizue came up. I have another question: why does Keiko opposes calling you Mamiko so vehemently?",
332,,Keiko,"Everyone's name ends with ""-ko"" in the Shrine. Mami is one of the precious few whose name doesn't follow this pattern, and I don't want her to change her name!",
333,,*,"Lemme think, I know five people from this Shrine, and the only two whose names end in ""-ko"" are Chizuko and Keiko. That's not a lot.",
334,,Chizuko,"Well, we also have Tamako, Chiko, Kyouko, Sakurako...Keiko and I are not the only ones with names like that.",
335,,Keiko,"We were orphans when the Shrine took us in. Ms. Mizue named all of us, which is why all our names end with ""-ko"".",
336,,Keiko,Mami is different: it's the name her parents gave her. It shouldn't be changed to be like us.,
337,,Mami,Most Shrine Maidens in the Shrine were abandoned by their parents. As for myself...I arrived after my parents passed away.,
338,,Mami,"Keiko still has faith in parents, and seems to believe that as long as the name doesn't end in ""-ko"", the child isn't abandoned.",
339,,*,I'm sorry to hear that. So Chizuko was...,
340,,Mami,"...Yes, but different. Usually, families who couldn't afford to raise a child will send their daughters here. We've never met Chizuko's parents: she was found in front of the Shrine's gates.",
341,,Mami,"It was snowing that day. If I wasn't sent to run errands out of the Shrine, I wouldn't have found her in time...but she was still left in the snow for far too long. I believe the over-exposure to the cold has affected her health.",
342,,,……,
343,,*,So all of them were orphans...I see why Mami cares so much about Chizuko now: she was the one who found her in the snow.,
344,,*,"All thanks to Enbi no Mikoto, they have a place to call home now. I should check back on Uriel to see whether she's up. It's probably time for us to visit Ms. Mizue for more stories.",
345,,Izanami,……,
346,,*,"...Wait, isn't that... I know you!",
347,,*,"You're...Izanami, right?",
348,,Izanami,"Observer of Yume. I wasn't planning on meeting you so soon, but since you have so generously given yourself up…",
349,,*,(Uriel isn't here... I'm not sure if I can best her in battle.),
350,,Izanami,You don't have to look so alarmed; I wasn't planning on actually fighting you in the Shrine.,
351,,*,"So you will do so when we're not in the confines of it? I'll take note of that when we eventually leave here. It's a truce now, right?",
352,,Izanami,You shouldn't trust the words of your enemy. I could be waiting for you to lower your guard and strike when you're least expecting me to.,
353,,*,"But you're not doing that, are you? Besides, I can feel the waves of depression that are rolling off of you right now...",
354,,Izanami,"This is why I detest those like you: way too perceptive for your own good... But that's not what I'm here for. Have you, by chance, met my Izanagi?",
355,,,Izanami described Izanagi's appearance in meticulous detail.,
356,,*,"I don't think I've ever met someone like that, sorry. Is she important to you? I'd ask the others if they have seen her.",
357,,Izanami,"She is my beloved... While I highly doubt that you can, if you manage to reunite us, I can leave Kratos' forces and join Yume.",
358,,Izanami,Now off you go: you should be heading to the Shrine Office for stories at this hour of the day.,
359,,*,How do you know that?? Have you been stalking me??,
360,Origin of the Trials,Uriel,Oh my... I can't believe I overslept. This is unbecoming behavior for a knight...,
361,,Uriel,I missed training too... I should wake up earlier tomorrow to make up for what I missed today.,
362,,*,"Hey, hey, don't be too hard on yourself. A character you like very much got the happy ending she deserved, and you're excited because of this. It's understandable.",
363,,Uriel,"She reminds me of Belinus, of what might have happened if... but that has nothing to do with slacking off at training!",
364,,Uriel,It will become a habit if I am not careful.,
365,,Mizue,"...As I said last time, Homura-Ōmikami slew Ao Oni, and ordered Enbi no Mikoto to establish a Shrine in Their honor.",
366,,Mizue,"Yet Ao Oni and Aka Oni are immortal; they draw energy from negative emotions, and will eventually regenerate their destroyed bodies and bring doom to Sawagi.",
367,,Mizue,Homura-Ōmikami imparted the knowledge that the amount of time the two brothers need to recover depends on the extent of damage done to their corpses.,
368,,Mizue,"To prolong their recovery, Homura-Ōmikami burned Aka Oni's body to ashes as well.",
369,,Mizue,"The ashes of the two brothers were sealed in another plane of existence created by the God, and it is only accessible from a room in the Shrine.",
370,,Mizue,"From their remains, their energies manifest as brutal monsters. Defeating such monsters will also help against their revival.",
371,,Mizue,"Entering the plane that we call the ""Realm of Trials"" to battle the monsters is an age-old tradition of our Shrine.",
372,,Mizue,"Shrine Maidens of Tsuruga as well as courageous people of Sawagi braved the Realm of Trials to engage in combat with the monsters, hoping to lengthen the time the Brothers needed to recover.",
373,,Mizue,"However, they were horribly outnumbered by the monsters, and casualties were large. Enbi no Mikoto prayed to Homura-Ōmikami, pleading the God for assistance.",
374,,Mizue,"In response to Enbi no Mikoto's prayers, Homura-Ōmikami created two artifacts:",
375,,Mizue,"One of them is the Pond of Prayers. It takes the shape of a regular Pond, but is in fact a bottomless reserve of treasures and artifacts.",
376,,Mizue,"True to its name, it will grant every wish and prayer.",
377,,Mizue,"However, it does not allow everyone to tap into its resources. This is where the second artifact, the ""Gaze of Gods"", comes in.",
378,,Mizue,"The ""Gaze of Gods"" is rumored to be a mirror that reflects nothing. One can reach into the mirror and obtain a key to the Pond of Prayers.",
379,,Mizue,"It is said that if you see yourself reflected in the ""Gaze of Gods"", it means that God is watching you through the mirror.",
380,,Mizue,"The mirror was entrusted to Enbi no Mikoto, who never hesitated to share the keys to challengers of the Trials.",
381,,Mizue,"The keys were shaped similar to the cranes who served the God, hence their name ""Origami Cranes"", or paper-folded cranes.",
382,,Mizue,"Back in the time, we believed those were rewards granted to the brave, and called them ""Symbols of Approval"".",
383,,Mizue,"With treasures and artifacts from the Pond of Prayers, the challengers finally stood a chance against the monsters in the Realm of Trials.",
384,,Uriel,"Ah, so that's how the Trials and the Pond of Prayers came to be...",
385,,*,"Does this mean that with the ""Gaze of Gods"", one can gain access to endless amounts of treasures?",
386,,Mizue,"Enbi no Mikoto showed no discrimination when distributing the ""Symbols of Approval"", as long as the challengers were willing to enter the Realm of Trials.",
387,,Mizue,"However, not everyone held noble intentions; some greedy challengers left as soon as the treasure came into their possession without taking on the monsters.",
388,,Mizue,"Infuriated, Enbi no Mikoto took the treasure back from the challengers that brought the treasure away from the Shrine, and stopped distributing ""Symbols of Approval"" freely. The treasure will only be granted moments before entering the Realm of Trials, and will be taken away once the challengers return from the Trials.",
389,,Uriel,Oh no... I don't believe the challengers will be happy with this change.,
390,,Mizue,"One night, a bunch of evil-willed challengers gathered with the sole aim to kill Enbi no Mikoto and pry the ""Gaze of Gods"" from her cold, dead hands.",
391,,Mizue,"The Shrine Maidens were unfortunately outnumbered, and those who could fight were worn out by the constant fights in the Realm of Trials. They were no match for the challengers.",
392,,Mizue,"Severely wounded, Enbi no Mikoto could only escape to the Realm of Trials with the ""Gaze of Gods"".",
393,,Mizue,The last thing she did was to shatter the mirror and toss the shards into the Realm of Trials so the challengers couldn't get to them.,
394,,Mizue,"As all hope of getting their hands on the sacred artifact was lost, the challengers left the Shrine in defeat. Since then, shards of the ""Gaze of Gods"" were scattered about in the Realm of Trials, never to be seen again.",
395,,Mizue,"The only method to obtain the treasures and ""Symbols of Approval"" was to enter the Realm of Trials and take on the Trials.",
396,,*,What an unbelievable end to this story...,
397,,Uriel,"Why, Enbi no Mikoto, why... Why is it always the ones that shine as bright as the sun that suffer such fates...",
398,,Mizue,"When the first rays of the sun fell upon Enbi no Mikoto's body, she turned into a crane and flew away.",
399,,Mizue,"We believe that she was yet again saved by Homura-Ōmikami, and ascended into the heavens to live happily ever after.",
400,,Chizuko,"Here you are, I have been looking for you! I guess Uriel cried again at this part of the story, am I right?",
401,,*,And you didn't? I remember you were devastated when Enbi no Mikoto was sold out by the people she sworn to protect. That's unexpected.,
402,,Chizuko,I don't think Enbi no Mikoto died.,
403,,Chizuko,"I believe that God saved her and brought her to the heavens to live happily ever after, just like Ms. Mizue said!",
404,,Uriel,Do you really believe that? That sounds awfully self-deluding...,
405,,Chizuko,But Homura-Ōmikami exists and They adore Enbi no Mikoto! They won't allow Enbi no Mikoto to waste away like that!,
406,,Chizuko,God must have wanted her to live in a better world than this one.,
407,,Chizuko,"I mean, Homura-Ōmikami could descend to the mortal world anytime if Enbi no Mikoto asked her to, and no mortal could stand against the wraith of Gods, right?",
408,,Chizuko,"At least, that's what I want to believe.",
409,,*,"You have a point. With the level of affection the God has shown her, I wouldn't be surprised if any miracles happened.",
410,,Uriel,"I guess so, but I still feel indignant for Enbi no Mikoto. She was a good person, and didn't deserve what the others did to her.",
411,,Uriel,But I suppose I can see it coming... The greedy ones won't be happy with Enbi no Mikoto's decision.,
412,,Chizuko,"According to ""The Chronicles of Tsuruga"", Enbi no Mikoto was only sixteen or seventeen at the time. It's perfectly understandable if her choices weren't very well thought-out.",
413,,*,"It's a pity that the ""Gaze of Gods"" is now lost. Imagine the amount of treasure you'd have if it's still in your possession!",
414,,Chizuko,"Well, you're not the first one to think like that. But anyone who causes mischief in the Shrine will be punished gravely!",
415,,,……,
416,,？？？,"Gaze of Gods, hm? It will be mine!",
417,Broken Trust,,"The next day, I passed the information we gathered so far to Ithil and KongMing.",
418,,*,...And that's all we've learned since we arrived here.,
419,,KongMing's Projection,"While the credibility of their story is doubtful, it can be deduced that the only method of obtaining the treasure is challenging the Trials.",
420,,Ithil's Projection,"But so far, they are the only source of information that we have. They might very well be making up a story to hide the true source of the treasure.",
421,,Ithil's Projection,...Which I suspect is still hidden somewhere in the Tsuruga Grand Shrine.,
422,,Uriel,"I don't know, the story seems plausible enough for me. Ithil's theory sounds a bit paranoid, to be honest.",
423,,KongMing's Projection,"No matter what the truth is, it is probably not common knowledge among the Shrine Maidens.",
424,,KongMing's Projection,"It's highly possible that only the Head Priestess and Senior Priestess are privy to that knowledge. From how Senpai described them, I doubt that they will be willing to reveal the secret to us.",
425,,*,"Why not? The Yume Academy is clearly the good guys... I mean girls, that fight against the Chaos.",
426,,*,"Surely we can convince the Shrine to supply us with some treasure, can't we? There's no need to go behind their backs.",
427,,KongMing's Projection,"(Sighs) Secrets are meant to be kept, Senpai. They wouldn't be secrets otherwise. As the most well-kept secret of the Tsuruga Grand Shrine, the probabilities of them sharing it with us are very low.",
428,,Ithil's Projection,"So far, the amount of treasure we have gathered from the Trials is inadequate for our cause, and time is not on our side.",
429,,Ithil's Projection,It would be to our advantage to find the source and try to replicate it here at Yume Academy.,
430,,*,... This doesn't sit well with me. Chizuko and Mami are kind and honest people. I'm sure they will be able to see from our perspective if we explained the situation to them.,
431,,*,"It wouldn't hurt to maintain good relationships with members of the Shrine. Since the Shrine Maidens are guardians of the Shrine, they might even be able to assist us in clearing the Trials.",
432,,Uriel,Like how Mami gave me tips on fighting before!,
433,,Ithil's Projection,"... You're the Senpai, I suppose. If you've made up your mind on this, we'll follow your lead.",
434,,*,"Thank you, Ithil.",
435,,Mami,Hmm? Isn't that * and Uriel? Why are they hiding in a corner? Are they speaking to someone?,
436,,Mami,"The most well-kept secret...""treasure""...""be on good relationships with members of the Shrine""… What is this?",
437,,Mami,I am a fool to have thought that you were different from the other outsiders. You outsiders are all greedy and ungrateful brutes who are here for the treasure only!,
438,,*,"What? No, Mami, why are you...",
439,,Mami,I overheard your schemes: your friendly act was only a disguise so you could steal the secret of the treasures from us!,
440,,Mami,"As no harm has been done yet, the Shrine's rules forbid me from taking any action.",
441,,Mami,"But I will be watching you. The moment you start something shady, I will be sure to make you regret every life choice of yours that led you to Tsuruga Grand Shrine. Hmph!",
442,,*,"Please, Mami, this is not what it looks like...",
443,,Uriel,"It's a misunderstanding, Mami, we can explain...",
444,,*,"Oh no, she just left without hearing us out. What should we do now?",
445,,*,And I was so close to befriending her...,
446,,Chizuko,"*, Uriel! What are you doing in this secluded corner? And why do you look so dejected?",
447,,Chizuko,"Did anything bad happen? If you are in the mood to talk, I'm all ears. I heard it's therapeutic to say what's bothering you out loud!",
448,,*,"Mami is mad at us, and I don't know what to do...",
449,,Uriel,There was a misunderstanding that we need to clear up. Do you know where we can find her?,
450,,Chizuko,"Erm, if Mami doesn't want to be found, I can guarantee you that no one will find her. I can try to pass on a message for you though!",
451,,*,"Thank you, Chizuko, but I think we should explain to her in person to avoid any more misunderstandings.",
452,,*,"Is it possible to arrange a meeting with her? Please? If she refuses to meet us, then I suppose we would have no choice but to write her a letter and hope that it reaches her.",
453,,Chizuko,"It's...hard, but not impossible, I think. Mami likes me a lot, and if I beg her, she might relent.",
454,,Chizuko,"It's not every day that you see Mami being on speaking terms with outsiders, and I think it's doing her a lot of good. I want all of you, especially her, to be happy, so I'll try my best!",
455,,*,"You're a lifesaver, Chizuko. We're relying on you.",
456,,,……,
457,,Uriel,I hope Chizuko can convince Mami to meet us...,
458,,*,"If she can't, then our only option is to leave her a letter, hoping that she'll actually read it. Anyhow, we must do our best to clear up this misunderstanding. We are not the greedy outsiders that she seems to believe us to be.",
459,,Izanami,"We meet again, Observer.",
460,,Uriel,"Be on guard, Senpai; she is a member of Krato's forces.",
461,,Izanami,"You haven't mentioned our encounter to your bodyguard, have you?",
462,,*,"It's okay, Uriel, I met her before. She wouldn't make a move on us now.",
463,,Uriel,What?! When did this happen?,
464,,*,On the day you overslept.,
465,,Uriel,"Do you have any idea how dangerous this is, Senpai? She could have killed you or seriously hurt you, and I would be blaming myself for shirking my responsibilities for the rest of my life!",
466,,*,"Relax, Uriel. I'm here and unscathed, am I not?",
467,,Izanami,"Hm, as entertaining as this was, shouldn't you be off to the storytelling session of the Shrine Maidens at this hour? What's keeping you?",
468,,*,"Yeah, about that...apparently we're bad, greedy people that have eyes only on the secrets of the Shrine now. In fact, Mami might be telling Ms. Mizue about us right now.",
469,,*,"So, probably not the best time for us to show up.",
470,,Izanami,"Secrets of the Shrine... You are talking about the ""Gaze of Gods"", aren't you?",
471,,Uriel,"Wait, you know about it too?",
472,,Izanami,"Oh, I saw it in its full glory. Since you're not going to hear this story from the Shrine Maidens, you might as well hear it from me.",
473,,Izanami,"After all, I do know a thing or two about what happened afterwards.",
474,Story time with Izanami,Izanami,"I can't remember the exact period of time when it happened, only that it happened long after Homura-Ōmikami swept Enbi no Mikoto away from the mortal world.",
475,,Izanami,"At that time, the Deity frequently made its presence known, sending messages to Shrine Maidens or causing miracles to happen.",
476,,*,"Huh, that's oddly detailed. One would think that you have actually lived through all this from the way you're telling this story.",
477,,Izanami,And what if I have?,
478,,Uriel,"Really? So is it true that Enbi no Mikoto isn't dead, just far away from here?",
479,,Izanami,She might be.,
480,,Uriel,Why do I feel like you're just trying to brush me aside?,
481,,Izanami,"One day, Ao Oni and Aka Oni reappeared to the astonishment of everyone.",
482,,Izanami,"The Shrine Maidens estimated that it would have taken more time for them to revive. Not only have they revived before the expected time, but they were also more powerful than before.",
483,,Uriel,"Ugh, those two again. Why did that happen?",
484,,Izanami,"Because of Chaos. They drew power from Chaos, which sped up their regeneration.",
485,,*,"You don't do cliffhangers, do you?",
486,,Izanami,"What for? You wanted to know what happened, and I'm telling you. If you wanted a storyteller, you'd have to look elsewhere.",
487,,*,"No, no, please continue. You mentioned Chaos, right? Just how far back in history do the Chaos go?",
488,,Izanami,"It's a mystery. After the monsters left the Realm of Trials, a mirror flew out of the Realm and landed in the hands of the then Head Priestess.",
489,,Izanami,"Rumor went that the ""Gaze of Gods"" will only appear at the Brothers' resurrection.",
490,,Izanami,"However, the treasure was ineffective against the monsters themselves. Allied with the forces of Chaos, the Brothers set out to take revenge on those that tried to stop their revival.",
491,,Izanami,"At times, they submerged Sawagi with water, and other times they wrecked the land with droughts. The Forces of Chaos took the opportunity to harvest as many human lives as they could.",
492,,Izanami,"The Sawagi people were not worried at first. After all, they had their own God watching over their home.",
493,,Izanami,They gradually lost their confidence as the Deity failed to resPond no matter how much the Shrine Maidens prayed.,
494,,Izanami,"In their panic, they flocked to the Shrine for refuge. It was the only establishment with the ability to protect everyone, with a team of Shrine Maidens trained specially to fight against the monsters in the Realm of Trials.",
495,,Izanami,Most made it to the Shrine. Some unfortunate ones didn't.,
496,,,"Izanami paused in her narration, absentmindedly touching the purple crystals on her face.",
497,,,"A tear slipped from her eye as she lost herself in her memories, muttering to a person that left her and broke her heart:",
498,,Izanami,"Izanagi, Izanagi... Don't look at me...",
499,,Izanami,"I am not infected by Chaos... I am not deformed... I will find a cure, as you wished...",
500,,Izanami,Don't leave...,
501,,Uriel,"W-What's going on, Senpai? She looks distressed.",
502,,Uriel,"(Whispers) From what she's saying, this Izanagi person left her because they thought she was ""deformed""?",
503,,*,(Whispers) She told me that Izanagi was her lover.,
504,,*,"Snap out of it, Izanami! Izanagi is not here!",
505,,Izanami,"No... You are not here... Where have you gone? I will find you again, Izanagi...",
506,,Uriel,"This isn't right... No matter who this Izanagi person is, they shouldn't have left their beloved because they were infected and scarred by Chaos.",
507,,Uriel,"...Wait a minute, what if this is another misunderstanding, just like Mami and us?",
508,,Uriel,Perhaps that is not the whole truth...,
509,,Uriel,"Yes, Izanagi might have left you without a goodbye, but what if they caught wind of a cure, and had to leave at once or risk losing the lead?",
510,,Uriel,And they never returned because they haven't found the cure and vowed not to return until they have done so. They wanted your reunion to be a happy one.,
511,,Izanami,"Is that so... Is this why you never returned, Izanagi? Because you love me?",
512,,*,It's likely!,
513,,*,(Whispers) Are you sure? She looks hopeful.,
514,,Uriel,"(Whispers) Not really, but the possibility exists.",
515,,Uriel,"(Whispers) Besides, if Izanagi truly abandoned her, then I highly doubt that they will ever meet each other again. What's the harm in letting her have some hope?",
516,,Uriel,"Chizuko's positivity is infectious; I want to believe that there is potential for every story to lead to a happy ending. Even yours, Izanami.",
517,,Izanami,"Hmph, I know that you're just trying to comfort me, but you did open my eyes to the possibility.",
518,,Izanami,"If we meet on opposite sides of the battlefield next time, I can spare your lives once.",
519,,*,"Gee, thanks, I feel so loved. I'd appreciate it a lot if we don't end up as enemies though.",
520,,Izanami,"... We should continue with the story. The Shrine Maidens never lost hope, and prayed to Homura-Ōmikami day and night.",
521,,Izanami,"Finally, The Deity resPonded to their prayers: the sun rose at midnight with the shrill chirp of a crane one night.",
522,,Izanami,"Bright rays of dawn chased away the night that enveloped Sawagi, and the Brothers were yet again reduced to ashes when sunlight fell upon them.",
523,,Izanami,"The people say that the sun was the manifestation of Homura-Ōmikami, and the crane that flew beside the sun as it climbed above the horizon was Enbi no Mikoto.",
524,,Izanami,"The Forces of Chaos were vanquished, and the ashes of Ao Oni and Aka Oni were returned to the Shrine.",
525,,Izanami,"The Shrine Maidens sealed both their ashes and the ""Gaze of Gods"" back into the Realm of Trials.",
526,,Izanami,"After renovations to the buildings wrecked by the Brothers' breakout were finished, Tsuruga Grand Shrine hosted a Grand Ceremony to express their thanks to the God, yet received no response.",
527,,Izanami,"In fact, that was the last time the God was seen in Sawagi.",
528,,Izanami,"However, the Sawagi people believed that Homura-Ōmikami never left them, since the Pond of Prayers still functioned as before.",
529,,*,And you lived through all of this? Wow...,
530,,Izanami,"Some are my own experiences, and others I gathered from the locals when I returned later.",
531,,Izanami,I do not trust that God: They are not as good and noble as the Sawagi people believe Them to be.,
532,,Izanami,"All They want was the faith of Their disciples: if They did care, They could have destroyed the Chaos anytime! And I would never be deformed by these vile scars!",
533,,Uriel,"I-I think I have heard about this. Before I came to Yume Academy, that is.",
534,,Uriel,"When I still belonged to the Order of the Sun, a senior knight once told me that her team was assigned to defend a region against Chaos, and to take down a God that has taken residence there.",
535,,Uriel,"However, the Chaos were destroyed when they arrived. The locals said it was a miracle.",
536,,Uriel,They investigated and found that the God died protecting the land from Chaos.,
537,,Uriel,"Now that I think about it... She said that the land was named ""Sawagi"".",
538,,Uriel,I don't know why They didn't take any action against the Chaos in the beginning. Perhaps it wrongly believed that the Chaos was no match for it... and paid dearly for this misjudgment.,
539,,Izanami,"Homura-Ōmikami died... protecting us? I, I don't...",
540,,,……,
541,,？？？,"(Cackles) Ah, Ahhh, so the Brothers' resurrection is tied to the ""Gaze of Gods""... I know just the thing to do now!",
542,"""Yume Academy""",,（Bells clanging),
543,,*,Arrgh... Go away...,
544,,Uriel,"No time for sleeping, Senpai! Those are emergency alarms. Get up!",
545,,*,H-huh? What's going on?,
546,,,……,
547,,*,Can anyone fill me in on the situation? Why is everyone running?,
548,,Kugatsu,(Shouting) There has been a breach of security in the Realm of Trials! Please stay away from the entrance and leave the premises as soon as possible!,
549,,Kugatsu,"I repeat, please steer clear of the entrance and leave the premises!",
550,,Uriel,"A breach of security...? Sounds ominous, especially when Ao Oni and Aka Oni is involved.",
551,,Uriel,"Look, a group of Shrine Maidens is approaching the entrance to the Realm of Trials instead of escaping from it!",
552,,*,"Oh no, Mami is among them too! We must help her!",
553,,Kugatsu,"Stop right there! If you want to leave unscathed, you should be running away from the Realm of Trials, not towards it.",
554,,*,But... But... Mami and the others are heading towards the Realm too! Why aren't you stopping them?!,
555,,Kugatsu,They are trained and prepared for situations like this one. You are not.,
556,,*,We can still help! We've cleared the Trials repeatedly now.,
557,,Uriel,"We consider Mami as a friend, and we will never leave a friend in need. If there is anything that we can help with, we will do it.",
558,,Kugatsu,... I suppose I should trust Ms. Mizue's judgment this time. Don't make me regret this.,
559,,*,You won't.,
560,,Kugatsu,"Mami belongs to a special force of Shrine Maidens, the Blazing Eagles.",
561,,Kugatsu,"The Brothers sealed in the Realm of Trials are showing signs of resurrection, and the Blazing Eagles are sent to buy time for everyone else to escape.",
562,,Kugatsu,"We are no match for them. Without Homura-Ōmikami's assistance, we have no chance of winning.",
563,,Kugatsu,"To make matters worse, the Beasts of Chaos have appeared by their side just like what happened in the past.",
564,,Kugatsu,This is the last chance for you to change your minds. You can still choose to leave and to live.,
565,,*,"Well, I don't know about Monsters, but Chaos Beasts are right in our area of expertise.",
566,,Uriel,"After all, we're from the Yume Academy!",
567,,*,"Uriel, I need you to gather the other Girls who were sent here so we can take on the Chaos Beasts together.",
568,,*,I will join forces with Mami.,
569,,Uriel,"Are you certain? The Realm of Trials is not safe now... I can always go in your place, and the Girls will resPond to your orders faster than mine.",
570,,*,"We don't have time for this argument, Uriel. Trust me; I won't go down that easily.",
571,,Uriel,"... If you insist. Be safe, Senpai.",
572,,Izanami,"Listen to your Senpai, young Knight. I'll make sure your Senpai returns to you safe and sound.",
573,,*,Wha-Izanami?!,
574,,,……,
575,,Mami,"Take this, you brute! This broom is gifted to me by Homura-Ōmikami, and works best against vile creatures like you!",
576,,*,Mami!,
577,,Mami,"Ugh, you again. Go away, I don't have time to deal with you now.",
578,,Mami,And why is another girl accompanying you instead of Uriel? Did you ditch her?,
579,,Izanami,"Oh, no. I have no intentions of starting another relationship just yet.",
580,,*,It's not what it looks like between Izanami and me! And we're here to help!,
581,,Mami,"Help? We're here as a suicide squad, not as treasure hunters!",
582,,Mami,"Treasure seekers like you should be running for your lives, not towards danger.",
583,,*,"I know you don't trust me after what you overheard, but please let us help you.",
584,,*,I am the Observer of Yume Academy and am experienced in dealing with Chaos Creatures.,
585,,*,"Besides, we never did clear up that misunderstanding yet, and we can't do that if you're six feet under, can we?",
586,,Mami,"You... Fine, if we end up pulling through, I will listen to what you have to say. No promises on forgiveness though.",
587,,*,It's a date!,
588,,Izanami,"If you are done with flirting, I can use some help dealing with these Chaos Beasts here.",
589,,Izanami,"You'd think people would be more considerate when you're separated from your lover, but no, they have to rub salt in the wound... (Mutters)",
590,,Mami,I'm not... We're not... Ugh. Let's get this over with.,
591,,Yume Academy Students,We're here to help!,
592,,Uriel,I rounded up everyone I could find. I hope we're not too late...,
593,,*,"Nope, you're right on time!",
594,,*,"Annnnd now, it's time to show these Monsters and Chaos Beasts why it's a bad idea to mess with Yume Academy!",
595,Michinashi,*,"Gwen, Brigit, mind giving that Shrine Maiden over there a hand? She looks overwhelmed.",
596,,Gwen & Brigit,"On it~\nO butterfly, fluttereth thy wings!",
597,,*,"Von Helsing, behind you!",
598,,Von Helsing,Too slow... It's hunting time.,
599,,*,"Angelica, I need you to take care of the Chaos Beasts on the western front!",
600,,Angelica,Consider it done... My arrows shall bring me honor!,
601,,*,"Holly, what's the status of the wounded?",
602,,Holly,"Don't worry, Senpai, everyone in the forest is with me~",
603,,Mami,"Huh, you weren't bluffing about being professionals.",
604,,*,"I am really tempted to say something obnoxious like ""I told you so"" right now…",
605,,Mami,"Yeah, yeah, rub it in. If you're such a hotshot, then you wouldn't turn down some friendly competition to see who takes down more Monsters and Chaos Beasts, will you?",
606,,Mami,I'll even let you have a head start since I'm well-trained to take down those Monsters.,
607,,*,"You might be, but what about those Chaos Beasts? I have way more experience dealing with them than you.",
608,,Mami,"Hmph, we'll see.",
609,,？？？,"Tch, where did these losers come from? I could have overwhelmed those Shrine Maidens easily...",
610,,？？？,Can they be from the Yume Academy that are rumored to have defeated Dire and Magma Demon?,
611,,？？？,"Ao Oni and Aka Oni are useless; with the amount of Chaotic Energy that they have absorbed, they should be revived now, but no.",
612,,？？？,"I wouldn't have given them this much of my powers if it wasn't for the ""Gaze of Gods"".",
613,,？？？,"Those fools only have their eyes on the treasure from the Pond of Prayers, overlooking the ""Gaze of Gods"", which is an impressive artifact itself.",
614,,？？？,"Ah, I know just what to do to hasten the rebirth of these two Brothers...",
615,,,……,
616,,*,"What's going on?! We had the situation under control, but these Monsters and Chaos Beasts came out of nowhere!",
617,,Mami,(Pants heavily) Us Shrine Maidens have been working with the challengers to fight against the waves of Monsters through the years. We've never fully vanquished them.,
618,,Mami,"However, the energies from the negative emotions aren't enough for the Brothers to revive yet. The Monsters must have been stirred up by the Chaos...",
619,,Mami,I thought we would be able to pull through with your help since this is Chaos-related.,
620,,Mami,... But it seems like I am wrong.,
621,,*,"...Something doesn't add up. I don't know much about Monsters, the Brothers, or energies from negative emotions, but the Chaos Beasts are not acting the way they should.",
622,,Izanami,"That is true. These Chaos Beasts are overexerting themselves with a clear aim, while they usually go after any trace of energy mindlessly.",
623,,Izanami,"There must be another intelligent Chaos being manipulating them, one that overpowers the regular Chaos Beasts.",
624,,*,Powerful and intelligent Chaos Creature... This sounds awfully like another Chaos Lord.,
625,,Mami,A Chaos Lord?,
626,,*,"A higher being among the Forces of Chaos... We've slain two already, and we can certainly defeat a third one.",
627,,*,"It shouldn't be too far away if it is controlling these Chaos Beast. Girls, can you check for anything out of place?",
628,,Gwen & Brigit,All clear on the eastern and southern fronts!,
629,,Angelica,Nothing in the west either.,
630,,Uriel,"Senpai, I spotted a suspicious entity in the north!",
631,,*,We're on our way!,
632,,,……,
633,,？？？,You.,
634,,*,"Wait, a human? But you are oozing Chaotic Energy...",
635,,？？？,"Ah, you must be referring to this human body. A rather useful one, I'd say, especially when I need to stay under the radar.",
636,,？？？,"As you have found me, it has exhausted its usefulness. As a reward... I shall reveal to you my true name and form.",
637,,Michinashi,"I am Michinashi, a Chaos Lord. Learn to fear this name, and cower when it is uttered.",
638,,*,A Chaos Lord!,
639,,Izanami,"Strange, it seems weaker than other Chaos Lords...",
640,,Izanami,Though what it lacks in strength is probably made up for in stealth. I wouldn't complain; it does make my life easier.,
641,,Uriel,"Repent your sins to the rays of the sun, vile creature…",
642,,Uriel,... And regret every decision that led you to defile the land that Enbi no Mikoto vowed to protect!,
643,Kagura Dance,Michinashi,No! I refuse to accept this!,
644,,Michinashi,"Puny humans like you shouldn't be able to best me! If the two useless Brothers hadn't drained so much energy from me, you would be dead now!",
645,,Michinashi,"But don't think you've won: even if I will be no more, the Brothers are already revived. You will all die here. Muahahahaha!",
646,,Michinashi,"Too bad that I won't be here when the ""Gaze of Gods"" is assembled again... I envy the lucky one who manages to get their hands on it...",
647,,Mami,"Hey, is it just me, or is the earth rumbling?",
648,,,The ground started to shake violently.,
649,,Uriel,"Senpai, look!",
650,,,Countless Monsters poured out from the entrance of the Realm of Trials.,
651,,,Two ominous and gigantic figures stood among the expanding swamp of Monsters created from negative emotions.,
652,,Ao Oni,"We live again, Brother... And with our rebirth, we shall bring doom to everyone who dares to stand in our way.",
653,,Mami,Is there truly no more hope for us...?,
654,,*,Don't lose faith yet --- look!,
655,,,A ray of light protruded from the veil of negative emotions enveloping the entrance to the Realm of Trials.,
656,,,"It came from a mirror, shining as bright as the rising sun, and dispersed the night with its radiance.",
657,,,"As its spectators marveled at its brilliance, the mirror flew into the Shrine and disappeared out of sight.",
658,,Ao Oni,That is... The artifact of that God! It will not fall into the hands of you hateful mortals this time!,
659,,Uriel,"Was that the ""Gaze of Gods""?",
660,,Mami,"It is our only hope. I have to stay and fight with the Blazing Eagles. Can I trust you to bring it back to us, *?",
661,,*,"Oh, you're not worried that a ""greedy outsider"" like me will just make off with it and leave now?",
662,,Mami,"No, I'm not. You have proven yourself to be worthy of my trust.",
663,,,……,
664,,*,"The ""Gaze of Gods"" flew in this direction... Over there! It's still glowing!",
665,,Chizuko,……,
666,,*,Chizuko? I thought you left with the others. What are you doing here?,
667,,Chizuko,……,
668,,,Monsters noticed them and huddled in their direction.,
669,,*,"Look, it's dangerous here, and I'm on my way to retrieve the ""Gaze of Gods"". Can you get to safety by yourself?",
670,,Chizuko,……,
671,,,"There was no indication that Chizuko heard *'s words, nor did she react to the Monsters gradually closing up on her. She just walked slowly forward.",
672,,*,"Something's wrong, but what? Michinashi is dead, and there are no signs of Chizuko being possessed by Chaos.",
673,,*,I can't leave her alone like this...,
674,,,"As * fought the Monsters, Chizuko kept walking towards the ""Gaze of Gods"".",
675,,,"The artifact slowly descended from the sky, and turned into a ray of light that entered Chizuko's small frame.",
676,,Chizuko,……,
677,,*,Is Chizuko... dancing? And the birds flanking her are... Cranes?,
678,,Shrine Maidens,"""...the moves were smooth and graceful as she twisted and twirled unscathed in the flames meant to harm her.""",
679,,Shrine Maidens,"""All of a sudden, the sounds of birds flapping their wings could be heard, and a flock of black, white, and red birds appeared on the horizon.""",
680,,*,Is that the fabled Kagura Dance?!,
681,,Chizuko,……,
682,The Awakening,,Earlier that day---,
683,,Chizuko,"This way, everyone!",
684,,Chizuko,"Oh, please don't push the person in front of you, this wouldn't help you escape faster!",
685,,Chizuko,……,
686,,Chizuko,The Shrine is mostly vacated now... I think it's okay for me to leave too.,
687,,Chizuko,I'm worried about Mami and the others. I could have been fighting with them if I wasn't so frail and weak...,
688,,Chizuko,... Wishful thinking like that wouldn't help them now. I should trust them; members of the Blazing Eagles are well-trained for situations like this.,
689,,Chizuko,I need to get to safety so they won't be worried about me.,
690,,Chizuko,It's fine...,
691,,Chizuko,……,
692,,Chizuko,Where...am I? Where am I heading to...?,
693,,Chizuko,"I feel warm and floaty, like walking on clouds...",
694,,？？？,♪~♪~♪~,
695,,Chizuko,Who are you...?,
696,,Chizuko,Are you calling for me...?,
697,,？？？,♪~♪~♪~,
698,,Chizuko,I am... Chizuko.,
699,,Chizuko,I am...,
700,,Chizuko,Wh-What's going on?! And what am I wearing?,
701,,*,"Welcome back, Chizuko, you really got us worried back there. How do you feel now?",
702,,Chizuko,*? What happened? Why am I here?,
703,,*,"No idea. I tried to talk to you, but you didn't seem to have heard me and started to dance after you walked here.",
704,,*,"Oh, and the ""Gaze of Gods"" seems to have fused with you somehow. Can you feel it?",
705,,Chizuko,Fused with me? So it's inside me?? But I don't feel anything!,
706,,,"A Monster charged at Chizuko, screaming shrilly.",
707,,*,Watch out!,
708,,Chizuko,Ahhhh! Go away!!,
709,,,"Chizuko thrust her arms forward to shield herself from the Monster, only for a beam of sunlight to shine out from her long sleeves and searing it to ashes.",
710,,*,"That was awesome, Chizuko, I didn't know you could do that!",
711,,Chizuko,"Wait, I did that?",
712,,Shrine Maiden,"(Screams from far away) Kyouko! Stay with us, Kyouko!!",
713,,Aka Oni,"Muahahahaha, all of you shall perish!!",
714,,Chizuko,It's Mami and the Blazing Eagles! They're in danger...,
715,,Chizuko,"I was weak before, but with this power...",
716,,Chizuko,... I can help!,
717,,,……,
718,,Mami,Something is flying towards us. Those are... cranes!,
719,,Kyouko,This light... Our God is back with us...,
720,,Ao Oni,"You are a lot shorter than I remembered you to be, Homura-Ōmikami.",
721,,Ao Oni,It's impossible! How are you still alive?!,
722,,Chizuko,"(Get a grip on yourself, Chizuko. Do not be intimidated by these Monsters.)",
723,,Chizuko,(I have the power to protect everyone in the Shrine. I will not back down!),
724,,Chizuko,"No matter what you say, vile creatures, I will put a stop to your evil deeds today!",
725,,Mami,(Whispers) This voice... Chizuko? It's happening now...,
726,,*,"Uh, yes, it's Chizuko. Are you alright, Mami? Are you hurt or injured anywhere?",
727,,Mami,"Hmph, of course not. Who do you think I am?",
728,,Mami,(Whispers furiously) Don't tell anyone else about Chizuko!,
729,,*,"Don't worry, I'm not planning on doing that. Wait, did you know that this will happen to her?",
730,,Mami,It's a long story. I'll explain later.,
731,,Ao Oni & Aka Oni,Homura-Ōmikami! We shall not fall to you once more. Face our hatred!,
732,,Chizuko,"You may try, but know that you are doomed to fail. Be prepared to repent for your sins!",
733,New Allies,,"Last night, when the light faded, both the Brothers and the Monsters disappeared.",
734,,,"Chizuko was unconscious, and Mami carried her all the way back.",
735,,Chizuko,"I heard from the others that you helped us with fighting the Chaos creatures and the Monsters! I can't thank you enough for everything you have done for us, *!",
736,,Chizuko,I can't believe I slept through all of that and even missed witnessing Homura-Ōmikami in Their full glory...,
737,,*,"Uh Chizuko, but wasn't it...",
738,,Mami,Ahem.,
739,,,Mami cleared her throat and glared.,
740,,*,"...Uh, yeah, I'm sorry that you missed it too.",
741,,Chizuko,"Thankfully, Mami promised that she will tell me everything in detail.",
742,,Chizuko,"Besides, if the only time Homura-Ōmikami will appear is when the Monsters are invading this world, I'd settle for never seeing Them.",
743,,Kugatsu,"I apologize for interrupting you in the middle of a conversation, Chizuko, but we have important matters to discuss with our honored guests from Yume Academy.",
744,,Chizuko,"Oh, you're going to talk about secrets! I'll get going then.",
745,,Kugatsu,"I had a discussion with President KongMing yesterday, who explained your situation.",
746,,*,KongMing? Is she here?,
747,,Mami,"Nope, you just dropped your communicator. I found it when I was sweeping.",
748,,Mami,"She was attempting to contact you, so we talked to her. I'm sorry for the misunderstanding, by the way.",
749,,*,"It's okay, we were acting quite suspicious in retrospect.",
750,,*,Is everything resolved yesterday? Are there any more threats or dangers lingering on the horizon?,
751,,Kugatsu,"Everything is under control now. The Brother's ashes are sealed securely in the Realm of Trials, and the ""Gaze of Gods"" has been restored to its rightful place as well.",
752,,Kugatsu,As for what happened to Chizuko... I implore you to keep Chizuko's conditions in secrecy for now.,
753,,*,"By the way, what actually happened to her? And why doesn't she remember anything today?",
754,,Kugatsu,Chizuko has the potential to be a vessel of Homura-Ōmikami's powers. She can draw upon Their strength through her prayers.,
755,,Kugatsu,"We were worried that she would not be able to comprehend the implications of hosting such powers at a young age, so we kept it a well-hidden secret and treated her as we would any other Shrine Maiden.",
756,,Kugatsu,"Her loss of memory can probably be ascribed to her being overwhelmed by the divine strength of Homura-Ōmikami. Personally, I feel like not having this memory is more a blessing than a curse for her.",
757,,*,"I see... Don't worry, I won't blab.",
758,,Kugatsu,"Thank you. I would also like to inform you that Chizuko will leave with you on your day of departure, and enroll in Yume Academy.",
759,,Kugatsu,"While we will never cease worrying for her, your actions yesterday have proven your trustworthiness. Combined with the fact that both Mami and Ms. Mizue vouched for you, I believe that you will take good care of her.",
760,,Kugatsu,"I brought this up in my discussion with President KongMing last night, and all the arrangements have been made.",
761,,*,That's unexpected. Do you mind me asking why?,
762,,Kugatsu,"Our training here at Tsuruga Grand Shrine only involves fighting against Monsters, but not Chaos Creatures, which is a field that Yume Academy specializes in.",
763,,Kugatsu,"Currently, Chizuko is next in line for the position of Head Priestess. However, she will need more training before she can be qualified to succeed Ms. Mizue as leader of the Shrine.",
764,,Kugatsu,President KongMing has also confirmed that she meets all the requirements to enroll in Yume Academy and that there is space for her on campus.,
765,,*,Don't worry! We're all very friendly and welcoming at the Academy. I reassure you that she will be in good hands.,
766,,Kugatsu,"In exchange, Tsuruga Grand Shrine will provide some aid for Yume Academy.",
767,,Kugatsu,"Usually, we Shrine Maidens only keep a bare minimum of ""Symbols of Approval"" for our use, and return the rest to the Realm of Trials.",
768,,Kugatsu,"Starting from now, we will entrust the ""Symbols of Approval"" we acquired from the Realm of Trials to Yume Academy.",
769,,Kugatsu,We will also share some tips on the Trials. We hope that these would be of help to your confrontation against Chaos.,
770,,*,Thank you... This means a lot to us.,
771,,Kugatsu,"You have helped us in our hour of need; now, we are merely returning the favor.",
772,,Kugatsu,"That's all I have to say. If you have no more questions, I'd be taking my leave. There are still many issues from last night waiting to be resolved.",
773,,*,"Good luck with that. Well, I suppose it's time for me to head back now.",
774,,Mami,"Not so fast, *. Despite the commotion last night, the Ceremony tonight will be held as planned.",
775,,Mami,Chizuko asked me to inform you that she would like to be your guide in the Ceremony and to wait at the gates tonight.,
776,A Happy Ending,Chizuko,Senpai! Uriel! I'm over here!,
777,,*,I thought I'm not your Senpai until you officially enroll in Yume Academy?,
778,,Chizuko,"True, but I like calling you Senpai! It feels like we are closer this way.",
779,,Uriel,"Chirpy as always, Chizuko.",
780,,Chizuko,It beats pulling a long face every day in my books. Let's go! There are so many stalls that you should visit!,
781,,,……,
782,,Chizuko,You have to try Sakurako's Takoyaki! They're to die for!,
783,,Chizuko,"Oooh, there's the Goldfish Scooping Stall of Kotoko! The goldfish there are very healthy and can live for a long time.",
784,,Chizuko,"It's getting pretty busy now... This way, I know the best spot to watch the fireworks!",
785,,*,She sure looks like she's having fun.,
786,,Uriel,But she's a good guide. The takoyaki is exquisite!,
787,,*,"Huh, these masks look familiar...",
788,,Chizuko,"Oh, those are masks of Ao Oni and Aka Oni based on their descriptions in the legends.",
789,,Chizuko,I think they're changing the designs next year since we've seen what they look like now.,
790,,Uriel,"To be honest, I thought such designs would scare you after what they did, but you're surprisingly okay with them.",
791,,Chizuko,A Head Priestess in the past once said that we should face our fears instead of hiding from them.,
792,,Chizuko,"It went something along the lines of ""If poor imitations could paralyze you with fear, then what will you do when you face the real deal?""",
793,,Uriel,She has a point.,
794,,Chizuko,"This reminded me. You joined our lessons halfway through, so you missed the beginning!",
795,,Uriel,The beginning? Is Enbi no Mikoto involved anyhow?,
796,,Chizuko,"You've become quite the Enbi no Mikoto fan too! Sadly, that would be a no. It's actually about Ao Oni and Aka Oni.",
797,,Chizuko,"Ao Oni and Aka Oni were born in the faraway village of Tsuyuoka. They had no father, and their mother was an ordinary human being.",
798,,Chizuko,"One night, the skies were painted an ominous shade and Monsters roamed the land. Their mother found herself pregnant and gave birth to the Brothers after ten days.",
799,,Chizuko,"She was horrified when she saw her babies' deformed faces and the horns that grew from their foreheads, signs of them being of demonic nature.",
800,,Chizuko,"However, she couldn't bring herself to kill them and decided to raise them secretly.",
801,,Uriel,"...They were children. Even if they committed unspeakable crimes in their adulthood, they were innocent as kids.",
802,,Uriel,I probably would have made the same choice as the mother if I was in her shoes.,
803,,Chizuko,"When their mother discovered their powers, she laid down rules that regulated the use of their powers, hoping for them to have a normal childhood.",
804,,Chizuko,"Despite her efforts, Tsuyuoka still suffered from frequent droughts since the birth of the Brothers, because Aka Oni often snickered when its mother's back is turned.",
805,,Chizuko,The villagers soon discovered the culprit of the droughts. Their mother tried to flee the village with them but was captured by the enraged villagers.,
806,,Chizuko,"The people of Tsuyuoka beat the mother to death with rocks, and attempted to burn them alive in order to ""cleanse their sins"", a method that they learned from the legends.",
807,,Chizuko,"Ao Oni sobbed uncontrollably upon witnessing its mother's death, and its cries called upon thick rain clouds. Soon, Tsuyuoka was submerged by a flood brought by the heavy rain.",
808,,Chizuko,"The Brothers realized that the murderers of their mother were no match for them at all, and took their revenge by taking over Tsuyuoka.",
809,,Chizuko,"They demanded offerings of treasure from the people of Tsuyuoka, and a young girl to be sacrificed to them on the day of their mother's death.",
810,,Chizuko,They will then beat the sacrifice to death with a stone and burn her alive. How horrible!,
811,,*,"That's what the people of Tsuyuoka did to them, isn't it?",
812,,Uriel,"I don't think it's right to torture an innocent like that, even if their revenge is justified.",
813,,Chizuko,"That's why they're Monsters. Enbi no Mikoto was treated unjustly too, but she has always resPonded with kindness instead of hatred.",
814,,Uriel,That's why I admire her so much.,
815,,Chizuko,"Senior Shrine Maidens also told us to learn from Enbi no Mikoto, and not from the Monsters.",
816,,Chizuko,"And you know the rest: the people of Tsuyuoka prayed to their God, who defeated the Brothers.",
817,,Chizuko,The Brothers arrived here when they fled Tsuyuoka.,
818,,Chizuko,But they were still defeated by our God!,
819,,Uriel,It's a happy ending.,
820,,Chizuko,Yep!,
821,,,Boom! Boom! Boom! Three huge fireworks bloomed in the sky.,
822,,Uriel,"Woah, they're larger than the others, and so much prettier.",
823,,Chizuko,"Oooh, it's time for the Kagura Dance performance!",
824,,Chizuko,"Let's go! If we don't secure a good spot now, all we're going to be able to see will be the heads of the audience!",
825,Finding a New Teammate,,"To encourage its students to participate in the Trials of the Tsuruga Grand Shrine, Yume Academy is hosting its first ""Tsuruga Cup"" Contest.",
826,,,"To enter this contest, students need to team up with other students in their House, challenge the trials, acquire rewards from them, and hand in the rewards to the Academy.",
827,,,"The six Houses will be ranked based on the amount and value of rewards submitted by their students, and the House ranked at the top will receive a special present courtesy of the Student Union.",
828,,,Yume Academy stirred as students geared up to participate in this challenge that requires both luck and competence.,
829,,,"However, a certain student seems to be having a hard time finding teammates…",
830,,Bud Elf,Arrrgh!,
831,,Saint,"What's going on, Bud Elf? Why aren't you participating in the trials like the others?",
832,,Saint,"Without you, House Fairy is no match for House Human.",
833,,Bud Elf,"I wanted to, but Susan…",
834,,Susan,Elffie~ My dear Elffie~ Can you promise not to be angry at me? I have something important to tell you~,
835,,Bud Elf,What is it? Did you mess up the fertilizer mix again or forget to water the flowers yesterday?,
836,,Susan,"I did none of that!! Put your flower down, Elffie!!",
837,,Susan,"Well, my dear Elffie, here's the thing: your dear Susy has an emergency, and can't be your teammate for the Trials.",
838,,Susan,"You might want to find someone else to be your teammate~ Don't worry, I'm sure that everyone will kill to join your team~",
839,,Bud Elf,"… And that's why my previous teammate, Susan, is not here with me.",
840,,Bud Elf,"As per the rules of the Academy, students must form teams of at least two to take on the Trials, but I can't find anyone to join my team!",
841,,Saint,"What about other students in House Fairy? They can't all be teamed up already, right?",
842,,Bud Elf,Well…,
843,,Bud Elf,"Mio, I need to ask you something…",
844,,Mio,"Meow, it's Bud Elf! Mio did not pick Bud Elf's flowers today, no Mio didn't!",
845,,Bud Elf,"Wait, don't go yet…",
846,,Bud Elf,"Oh, hi Kassy. Do you want to challenge the Trials with me?",
847,,Kassy,"I'm sorry, Bud Elf, but I've already joined someone else's team.",
848,,Bud Elf,"It's alright, Kassy… What about you, Elloi?",
849,,Elloi,Youcan'tseemeyoucan'tseemeyoucan'tseeme…,
850,,Bud Elf,…Forget it.,
851,,Bud Elf,It's obvious that no one wants to join my team!,
852,,Saint,"That's a pity. If I wasn't in House Human, I'd love to be your teammate.",
853,,Saint,"However, as the former House President of House Human, it's my responsibility to lead House Human to victory.",
854,,Bud Elf,"Thank you, Saint.",
855,,Saint,"I should go; my teammates are calling for me. I wish you luck on your search for teammates. House Human will win fair and square, not because its rival is weakened.",
856,,Bud Elf,"… Okay! I don't need any lousy teammates anyway, I can clear a trial all on my own!",
857,,Bud Elf,"As long as no one catches me, I won't get in trouble for heading into the Realm of Trials alone!",
858,,Bud Elf,I will make them regret not teaming up with me!,
859,,？？？,"Please don't… It's too dangerous for you to go alone, Bud Elf…",
860,,Bud Elf,Who are you?? Let go of my leg!,
861,,Holly,I… I… I am…,
862,,Bud Elf,"Can't you speak a whole sentence without stuttering? Wait a minute, I think I know you. You're one of the juniors of our House, aren't you?",
863,,Bud Elf,"I don't know you that well, so feel free to go tell on me to Senpai and the others, but please let go of my leg.",
864,,Holly,"My name is… Holly… Whew, that was hard…",
865,,Holly,"I am not a snitch, but… but I won't let go either.",
866,,Holly,You're not supposed to take on a Trial alone… The rules state that the trials can only be challenged by two or more students!,
867,Bud Elf's Biggest Fan,Holly,I'm not letting go… It's too dangerous for you to go alone…,
868,,Bud Elf,"I don't have a choice! No one wants to team up with me, so the only way left is to go by myself.",
869,,Holly,I… I can try to persuade others to join your team…,
870,,Holly,"People are convinced that you are a soft-hearted person, so they underestimate your strength…",
871,,Holly,"When they finally open their eyes to how strong you are, everyone will want to take on the trials with you…",
872,,Bud Elf,Soft-hearted?,
873,,Bud Elf,Are you sure you're not talking about someone else?,
874,,Holly,I don't think so… It's impossible to mistake someone else for you!,
875,,Holly,You are extremely kind and patiently water me every day.,
876,,Holly,"You are the one who carries me out from the Greenhouse to bask in the sun,",
877,,Holly,and the one who chases the birds away when they come pecking at me…,
878,,Bud Elf,"Wait, I don't remember doing any of this for a person. Who are you?",
879,,Holly,"As I said, I am Holly… The climber plant on the trees of the Gardening Club…",
880,,Holly,"I return to my plant form from time to time to rest, but I never hurt those trees, nor have I drained nutrients from them…",
881,,Bud Elf,Senpai did tell me that one of the newbies was a sentient plant.,
882,,Bud Elf,"I thought he was talking nonsense, but it seems like I was wrong.",
883,,Bud Elf,"So you are that Holly, hmm? That explains why it disappears sometimes. I thought it died because I didn't take good care of it.",
884,,Holly,"But you did! You are always patient and kind to us, and all plants adore you!",
885,,Holly,I think that's why the other students don't believe that you can hold your own in the Trials…,
886,,Bud Elf,Pfft.,
887,,Holly,"… But they don't know about your incredible strength! No matter how heavy the flower pots are, you can carry them all by yourself.",
888,,Holly,"Once I tell them about this, they will know that you can pull your weight in the Trials, and you won't have to worry about not having teammates anymore!",
889,,Holly,"… Unlike me, who is no help at all because I'm just bad at PE.",
890,,Bud Elf,Hahahahahahaha!!,
891,,Bud Elf,"I have to admit, you're a funny one. The real reason that no one wants to team up with me is not because of my ""kindness"".",
892,,Bud Elf,Haven't you heard the names the others have for me?,
893,,Bud Elf,"One of the Seven Mysteries of the Academy, the nightmare of the Gardening Club, the local weirdo, the ""Power Girl""…",
894,,Holly,Wh-What?!,
895,,Bud Elf,"They do not shun me because I lack strength. On the contrary, they shun me because of my strength.",
896,,Bud Elf,"No matter what they think, I will not change my principles: whoever hurts plants will be punished!",
897,,Holly,But… But… The rules of Senpai and the Student Union…,
898,,Holly,And you need someone to watch your back no matter how strong you are…,
899,,Bud Elf,"Ugh, we're just going around in circles. Wait, aren't you in House Fairy too?",
900,,Bud Elf,"Then it's settled: you can come with me to challenge the trials. I have someone to watch my back, and you don't have to worry about me breaking the rules.",
901,,Holly,M-Me? But I… I can't… Please let go of me…,
902,,Bud Elf,You're the one that won't let go of my leg in the first place! Now stop whining and let's go!,
903,,Bud Elf,"Hahahaha, I'm finally in!",
904,,Holly,What should I do? I won't be of any help to Bud Elf in the Trials…,
905,Holly's Three Strengths,Holly,I… I…,
906,,Bud Elf,"Yeah, yeah, I've heard all the stories.",
907,,Bud Elf,"Like the one about how you managed to run slower than other people who aren't even running, the one about it taking 5 minutes to complete a 400-meter course,",
908,,Bud Elf,"the one about how nodding is your way of doing sit-ups, and the one about how you trip over yourself on flat ground.",
909,,Bud Elf,"I know all about those. Don't worry too much, it's just a Trial. I've got this.",
910,,Holly,… Can we please not talk about these embarrassing stories of mine?,
911,,Holly,"… On second thought, no, let's talk about them.",
912,,Holly,Then you should know perfectly well that I'm nothing but dead weight when it comes to anything too strenuous. I'm sorry for any trouble I may cause…,
913,,Bud Elf,"I insisted, didn't I? I will take responsibility if anything bad happens. You don't have to beat yourself up too much on this.",
914,,Bud Elf,"Besides, there must be something that you're good at.",
915,,Holly,"Uh… Um… Yes, but I don't think they will help…",
916,,Bud Elf,"Fine, change of tactics. List three things you're good at from the top of your head.",
917,,Holly,O-Okay?,
918,,Holly,"Erm, one, I'm a plant, so I can communicate with other plants, ask them for help, and know how to take care of them.",
919,,Bud Elf,That's pretty useful.,
920,,Holly,"But… the ""plants"" in the Realm of Trials are illusions, and they don't resPond to my words at all…",
921,,Holly,"In a real forest, I can ask the forest to bless us, but here…",
922,,Bud Elf,"One down, two to go. What else?",
923,,Holly,I… I can play the flute and sing. Senpai and other classmates said that my music is beautiful.,
924,,Holly,But I don't see how…,
925,,Bud Elf,"Go on, there's still one left!",
926,,Holly,Yes ma'am!,
927,,Holly,And… Uh… I know basic first aid…,
928,,Holly,… But Dr. Raphael and Vera are way better at this than me…,
929,,Bud Elf,"Well, those don't sound useless to me.",
930,,Holly,Really…?,
931,,Bud Elf,"You're a plant, and I like plants.",
932,,Bud Elf,"You know how to take care of plants, so we have a lot in common, and you don't annoy me as the others do.",
933,,Bud Elf,I feel at ease in the presence of someone else who shares my interests.,
934,,Bud Elf,And look at the trial grounds: there are nothing but enemies here.,
935,,Bud Elf,"You can play the flute and sing, so I won't get bored to death.",
936,,Holly,"If you would like to hear me play, then I'd be glad to oblige…",
937,,Holly,Does it really count as helping when all I do is keep you company?,
938,,Bud Elf,"At least you alleviate my bad mood, which is more help than I can say for some people.",
939,,Bud Elf,"Such as Aquaris, who serves only to annoy me. I'd probably end up beating her than the enemies in the Trials if we're in the same team.",
940,,Holly,"Um, should we be talking about Aquaris behind her back like this…?",
941,,Bud Elf,I'm just making an example.,
942,,Bud Elf,"What's more, you know first aid! I can confidently say that I know nothing about this. If I'm injured, then I have to wait until I clear this Trial before I can get my wounds looked at if you're not here.",
943,,Bud Elf,"You're being very helpful in my books. I'll handle the fighting, and you can handle everything else. Sounds good to you?",
944,,Holly,"… Yes! Yes, I'll try my best!",
945,,Holly,"Of course, I'll be glad if you don't get injured in the first place…",
946,Holly's Song,Holly,……,
947,,Bud Elf,"Relax, Holly. As I said, I'll handle the fighting.",
948,,Holly,"But… If you are injured, I need to know where the injuries are at…",
949,,Holly,I have to memorize their location so I can take care of them after the battle…,
950,,Bud Elf,"I think I'll know where my wounds are. You know, since they hurt?",
951,,Bud Elf,"The enemies are getting close. Hide somewhere safe, okay?",
952,,Holly,Okay. You won't have to worry about me!,
953,,,Bud Elf waved her flower menacingly and rushed towards the first wave of enemies.,
954,,Bud Elf,Take this!,
955,,Holly,"Wow, Bud Elf is so strong~",
956,,Bud Elf,Who's talking? It sounds like… Holly?,
957,,Bud Elf,At least she doesn't seem to be in any danger. Better get rid of these enemies first.,
958,,Holly,"That flower is huge, but Bud Elf makes it look effortless…",
959,,Holly,She's so cool!,
960,,Holly,I want to…,
961,,Bud Elf,… Why do I have a bad feeling about this?,
962,,Holly,♪Amidst the tune of the forest I sing♪\n♪The song of a legend second to none♪,
963,,Holly,♪Her strength unmatched♪\n♪Her courage unweakened♪,
964,,Bud Elf,"Uh, is she singing? About me?",
965,,Holly,"♪Against darkness, she stands♪\n♪From perils, she finds chance♪",
966,,Bud Elf,This is so cringe-worthy…,
967,,Holly,♪The wicked cower in fear♪\n♪As the pure blossom comes near♪,
968,,Bud Elf,One… Last… Enemy…,
969,,Holly,♪Within...Hmmmmmph!,
970,,Bud Elf,That's it! No more singing for you!,
971,,Holly,Hmmmph… Why?? I thought you liked my singing voice. All I wanted to do was to cheer you on…,
972,,Bud Elf,"Try a normal song next time! I mean, what were you even singing back there? None of that is true!",
973,,Bud Elf,… You shouldn't even be singing about me in the first place!,
974,,Holly,"What are you talking about? It's totally true! Sure, I might have embellished it a bit, but you're just that amazing!",
975,,Holly,"Besides, I'm the only one here to witness your awe-inspiring battles! I'm going to sing them to everyone once we return to the Academy.",
976,,Holly,And they will finally realize that they're missing out!,
977,,Bud Elf,Somehow I feel like this will backfire terribly…,
978,,Bud Elf,And please don't do that. Please.,
979,,Holly,"Oh no, there's a wound on your hand! Please sit down, I'll take care of it now.",
980,,Bud Elf,"You don't have to worry too much, Holly, it's just a small cut.",
981,,Holly,Are you injured anywhere else? I have the gauze and disinfectant ready.,
982,,Bud Elf,"Nah, that's the only one, and it's a small wound.",
983,,Holly,"(Blows on the wound) Pain, pain, go away…",
984,,Bud Elf,……,
985,,Holly,"Alright, it's properly wrapped now!",
986,,Bud Elf,"Erm, was it really necessary to wrap my entire hand?",
987,,Holly,Absolutely! All wounds have to be treated carefully!,
988,Some Things Never Change,Holly,So this is what happened in the Realm of Trials last time…,
989,,Susan,"Hahaha, that's right! Effie is just that awesome!",
990,,Susan,You're also something yourself. Not everyone has what it takes to be Effie's friend.,
991,,Holly,I still can't believe I really became friends with the legendary Bud Elf…,
992,,Bud Elf,"I don't mind the two of you chatting, but can you maybe move your conversation elsewhere? It's sort of uncomfortable when you're squished between two people…",
993,,Susan,Why should we? This is our way to show our affections~,
994,,*,"Huh, now that's not something you see every day.",
995,,Iron Fist,It's Holly and Bud Elf! They look like they're getting along really well.,
996,,Mio,Meow! Are you sure that Holly is not forced to be Bud Elf's friend?,
997,,Aquaris,Doesn't look like it. Look at that huge grin on Holly's face!,
998,,Aquaris,"Is Bud Elf more amiable now? If that's the case, I should go say hi!",
999,,Aquaris,"(Runs over) Hello, Bud Elf~",
1000,,Bud Elf,Aquaris? What are you-,
1001,,Bud Elf,Hm?,
1002,,Aquaris,Bud Elf! How did you get Holly to team up with you?,
1003,,Aquaris,… Did I say something wrong? Why are you glaring at me?,
1004,,Holly,"Uh, Aquaris, you might want to look down.",
1005,,,"Everyone looked at Aquaris, who shakily looked down.",
1006,,Aquaris,(Steps back) ……,
1007,,Susan,What a naughty flower! What is it doing outside of the flower bed?,
1008,,Iron Fist,"(Whispers) Aquaris, this is your cue to run.",
1009,,*,"(Whispers) Good luck, Aquaris.",
1010,,Aquaris,I'm sorry!!!!!!,
1011,,Bud Elf,You again! Trampling all over my beloved plant friends! I will hammer the lesson into your brick head this time!!,
1012,,Holly,And off they go…,
1013,,Susan,"Haha, Elffie runs as fast as I remembered~",
1014,,Holly,Are you sure everything is alright?,
1015,,Susan,"Of course! Aquaris is no match for Elffie, so there's nothing to worry about!",
1016,,*,"I think it's Aquaris we need to worry about, not Bud Elf.",
1017,,Iron Fist,It seems like nothing changed with Bud Elf after all.,
1018,,Mio,Meow… So is Bud Elf kinder to Holly because she is a plant?,
1019,,Holly,Of course not! Bud Elf is always kind!,
1020,,Mio,But… what about Aquaris?,
1021,,Holly,That's because she stepped on the flower. As long as no plants are hurt…,
1022,,Susan,I think Aquaris is secretly a genius at grating on Elffie's nerves. She never fails to make Elffie angry!,
1023,,Holly,That's right! So it's not Bud Elf's fault that she's always angry with Aquaris!,
1024,,*,"By the way, I saw you and Bud Elf registered as a team in the Realm of Trials. Is that how you got to know each other?",
1025,,Holly,Yes!,
1026,,*,How was it? Did you manage to get a lot of Origami Cranes?,
1027,,Holly,We did… Bud Elf was amazing…,
1028,,Holly,The treasure we got from the Pond of Prayers was extremely valuable as well… at least that's what President KongMing said.,
1029,,Iron Fist,Sounds like House Monster has to work harder to win this contest!,
1030,,Holly,I wrote a song praising Bud Elf back in the Realm of Trials…,
1031,,Holly,I'd like to share it with you…,
1032,,Holly,♪~……,
1033,,Aquaris,"Huff, huff, huff… I can't run anymore, please forgive me… Wait, is someone singing?",
1034,,Bud Elf,Holly!! I told you not to sing it anymore!!!,
1035,Sivney's Research,Sivney,Have you finished organizing the data?,
1036,,Bonnie,(Chirps merrily),
1037,,Sivney,"Good job, Bonnie!",
1038,,Sivney,"Now, if we put this together with the data that we finished organizing earlier…",
1039,,,……,
1040,,Sivney,It appears that items granted by the Pond of Prayers may have a connection with the wish made by the person offering the Origami Cranes…,
1041,,Sivney,"The more focused the person making the wish is, the more prone the Pond of Prayers will be to fulfill their wish exactly according to their thoughts.",
1042,,Sivney,"Hmm… I see. This is how ""the Gods respond to prayers made by the pure-hearted""…",
1043,,Sivney,"The Pond has a processor with psychic powers, but it lacks the ability to filter out distractors.",
1044,,Sivney,"Report 121 states that the subject wished for herbs and swords, but received a fanny pack instead.",
1045,,Sivney,My theory is that it identifies the category the wish is associated with based on past patterns and keywords. Irrelevant thoughts only serve to disrupt the processor from arriving at the desired result.,
1046,,Sivney,"Hmm, and if I factor in the influences of pronunciation and language structure of the ancient Tsuruga dialect…",
1047,,Bonnie,(Chirps disparagingly),
1048,,Sivney,"Haha, I wouldn't be surprised if you manage to do better than that.",
1049,,Sivney,"It IS ancient in terms of technology, after all.",
1050,,Sivney,"But we're not here to optimize it, are we? Our job is to figure out how it works so the Academy can utilize it better.",
1051,,Bonnie,(Chirps a suggestion),
1052,,Sivney,"Of course, I did consider taking it apart and studying its structure.",
1053,,Sivney,"I probably would have, but as you can see…",
1054,,Mami,(Glares),
1055,,Sivney,It might not be the best course of action when we have a guard watching us like a hawk.,
1056,,Sivney,"Now that I think about it, she seems to be oddly cautious of me despite the fact that we've never met before.",
1057,,Sivney,Perhaps a certain Senpai told her about me? Hmm…,
1058,,Sivney,"Ah, I'm getting off course. Back to our research… From what we've gleaned by analyzing these data, we can conclude that we should have the more simple-minded students make wishes.",
1059,,Bonnie,(Raises her wing),
1060,,Sivney,"Yes, certainly, you can have a try at this later too.",
1061,,Sivney,Moving on to our next topic: the correlation between the number of Origami Cranes offered and the result of wishes.,
1062,,Sivney,"So far, we can observe that the results agree with our expectations: the more Origami Cranes offered, the more valuable the prize will be.",
1063,,Sivney,"If the wisher offers one Origami Crane only for a life-saving elixir, the Pond will grant a licorice leaf. However, if the number of Origami Cranes offered is increased, then rarer herbs or even medicine pills may be granted.",
1064,,Sivney,"It should also be noted that the items from the Pond are up-to-date with the time period the wish was made, despite them being far after the time the Pond was created.",
1065,,Sivney,(Mumbles) How unfortunate. I would have loved to study the inner workings of the Pond of Prayers…,
1066,,Mami,(Glares),
1067,,Sivney,Ahem. There have also been reports of the wisher offering more Origami Cranes but receiving a less desired result.,
1068,,Sivney,What the Pond deems to be valuable seems to differ from the general crowd.,
1069,,Sivney,"Our next goal is to figure out the relationship between different types of wishes, the number of Origami Cranes offered and the quality of the rewards.",
1070,,Sivney,"Hmph, the data we have now is insufficient to deduce how to achieve the best results with the least cost.",
1071,,Sivney,"Come on, Bonnie, it's time for us to get our hands on some Origami Cranes for the sake of our research.",
1072,,Bonnie,(Chirps questioningly),
1073,,Sivney,"Going in teams? That rule is set to ensure the safety of students who dare to take on the trials, but I'm not a regular student, am I?",
1074,,Sivney,"Besides, that's why I have you, Bonnie. Let's go!",
1075,,Bonnie,(Hops and chirps merrily),
1076,,,"As Bonnie skips towards the entrance of the Realm of Trials, an invisible force rams into her and knocks her to the ground.",
1077,,Bonnie,(Chirps in pain),
1078,,？？？,"Ow, ow, ow…",
1079,,Sivney,"Hm, I smell blood… The person or beast that knocked you over must be invisible.",
1080,,Sivney,"Wait, the space on top of Bonnie is being distorted… It's the effects of Optical Camouflage!",
1081,,Sivney,Hello? Can you get up? You're crushing my Bonnie here.,
1082,,Bonnie,(Chirps weakly),
1083,,？？？,So-Sorry…,
1084,,Trinity,… Dr. Sivney?!,
1085,The Invisible Girl,Sivney,"Try moving your left wing, Bonnie.",
1086,,Bonnie,(Waves her left wing),
1087,,Sivney,Does it hurt if I squeeze it lightly like this?,
1088,,Bonnie,(Shakes her head),
1089,,Sivney,Great! Looks like the bone isn't broken.,
1090,,Sivney,"Phew, just when I was worried that I have to find myself a new research assistant…",
1091,,Bonnie,(Chirps indignantly),
1092,,Sivney,"I'm joking, Bonnie, no one is good enough to replace you. You're the best assistant I ever had.",
1093,,Sivney,"Well, well, well, let's see which bumbling fool almost murdered my best assistant…",
1094,,Trinity,Mana depleting… Entering Sleep Mode… Zzzz…,
1095,,Bonnie,(Ultimate Penguin Kick!),
1096,,Trinity,I've been ambushed-,
1097,,Trinity,"Wait, that's not right. I should be out of the Realm of Trials by now.",
1098,,Trinity,… Dr. Sivney?!,
1099,,Sivney,"I'm sorry, do I know you?",
1100,,Trinity,Wh-what?!,
1101,,Trinity,"Don't you remember me, Dr. Sivney?!",
1102,,Trinity,(Pouts),
1103,,Sivney,………………,
1104,,Sivney,"Aww, of course I remember you. I was just pulling your leg.",
1105,,Sivney,I can still recall making that Battle Suit…,
1106,,Trinity,Really? Then what's my name?,
1107,,Sivney,Hmm… You must be Skye!,
1108,,Trinity,！！！,
1109,,Sivney,"Ha, look at that expression on your face! It's Trinity, right?",
1110,,Trinity,So you knew all along…,
1111,,Sivney,(Not until the Battle Suit jogged my memory.),
1112,,Sivney,"Since you've just returned from the Trials, I'd like a detailed report on the situation inside the Realm of Trials.",
1113,,Sivney,I can also use another person to help me gather data for my research on the Pond of Prayers. I'll tell you what to wish for later.,
1114,,Trinity,"Erm, regarding the Trials…",
1115,,Trinity,Erm…,
1116,,Sivney,What's the matter? Don't tell me that you've forgotten how to deliver a proper report despite having studied under me…,
1117,,Trinity,"N-No, I will never forget what you taught me!",
1118,,Trinity,It's just… the data… Uh…,
1119,,,Trinity reluctantly recounted her experience in the Trials.,
1120,,Sivney,So let me get this straight: you stopped at the third stage due to a bout of drowsiness.,
1121,,Trinity,"I couldn't keep my eyes open. I managed to clear the stage I was in, but it would have been risky to venture into the next stage.",
1122,,Trinity,I didn't want you to know because it was so embarrassing…,
1123,,Sivney,What happened to your teammates? This shouldn't have been a problem if they were there to watch your back and wake you if you fall asleep.,
1124,,Trinity,None exist. They're always looking at me like I'm a freak! There's no way I'm teaming up with them!,
1125,,Trinity,"It's not a crime if you don't get caught, so I wouldn't be breaking school rules if no one caught me in the act.",
1126,,Trinity,"Hence the Optical Camouflage… Oops. Dr. Sivney, you won't tell on me, right?",
1127,,Sivney,"I have better things to do than being a tattle-tale… There, everything's recorded now. If there's nothing more to add, I'll be taking my leave.",
1128,,Trinity,"Uh, Dr. Sivney, what about the rules?",
1129,,Bonnie,(Chirps proudly),
1130,,Sivney,"Well, I'm not heading in there myself, am I? I'm teamed up with Bonnie, who is perfectly capable of pulling her weight.",
1131,,Trinity,"Wait, you can do that?",
1132,,Trinity,"… Can, can I go with you?",
1133,,Sivney,"I have nothing against that, but shouldn't you get your wounds treated first?",
1134,,Trinity,"Nah, they're minor ones that don't hinder my performance. Don't worry!",
1135,Trinity's Battle Suit,Sivney,I'm in!,
1136,,Bonnie,(Chirps),
1137,,Trinity,I'm in too… Owww…,
1138,,Trinity,No problems whatsoever...,
1139,,Sivney,Said by someone who landed on their face.,
1140,,Bonnie,(Chirps pityingly),
1141,,Trinity,Pl-please pretend that nothing happened…,
1142,,Trinity,"(Hisses in pain) Ugh, I think I reopened a wound…",
1143,,Sivney,Are you alright? You can rest on the sidelines if you need to.,
1144,,Trinity,(And waste my chance to impress Dr. Sivney? Never!),
1145,,Trinity,"It's nothing! Nothing, I say!",
1146,,,(Fizzes),
1147,,Trinity,What's that sound?,
1148,,Sivney,"There's smoke coming from your rifle, Trinity.",
1149,,Trinity,Soul Destruction took a hit from the monsters just now… Is it malfunctioning?,
1150,,Trinity,I have to fix it…,
1151,,Trinity,"The Energy Storage Cell is sending a warning message… Yikes, it's burning hot!",
1152,,Sivney,(Sighs) What now?,
1153,,Trinity,"Please give me some more time, I'll have it up and running again in no time!",
1154,,Trinity,Just a few more minutes…,
1155,,Sivney,……,
1156,,Sivney,"Fine, because I'm so kind…",
1157,,Bonnie,(Chirps disdainfully),
1158,,Trinity,This is fixed… This is also fixed… These parts need replacing…,
1159,,Sivney,"Hmm, you're pretty skilled at this. Have you been practising in your spare time?",
1160,,Trinity,"Yep! I've read through the notes you gifted me many times, and tried to make adjustments on the Battle Suit and Soul Destruction myself!",
1161,,Sivney,(Notes? But those have to be at least half a century old…),
1162,,Sivney,……,
1163,,Trinity,"On the topic of Battle Suits, there's something I've always wanted to ask…",
1164,,Sivney,Ask away.,
1165,,Trinity,"There's nothing strange with the Battle Suit's design, right?",
1166,,Trinity,I remember you telling me that this is normal in the outside world.,
1167,,Sivney,I did.,
1168,,Trinity,Phew… I told them that this style is common in outfits!,
1169,,Sivney,Although…,
1170,,Trinity,Although?,
1171,,Sivney,I don't remember the Battle Suit being this tight-fitting when I designed it…,
1172,,Sivney,Its material shouldn't shrink with wash…,
1173,,Trinity,(Splutters),
1174,,Trinity,"Is, is that so?",
1175,,Trinity,If the Battle Suit hasn't shrunk…,
1176,,Trinity,This means that… I've gained weight…,
1177,,Trinity,I should probably... Go on a diet…,
1178,,Bonnie,(Chirps meanly),
1179,,Sivney,"Oookay, I might have went a bit overboard.",
1180,,Sivney,"I was just teasing you, Trinity.",
1181,,Trinity,…Huh?,
1182,,Sivney,"The style of the Battle Suit is normal by my standards, but might be a bit too advanced for the general crowd.",
1183,,Sivney,Brilliant thoughts are often misunderstood by others…,
1184,,Sivney,"… But you're not the general crowd, are you, Trinity?",
1185,,Trinity,"Of course! Everyone can only dream of seeing the world as you do, Dr. Sivney!",
1186,Trying Too Hard,Trinity,…There! Soul Destruction is fully operational again!,
1187,,Trinity,"With it, I shall bring you victory!",
1188,,Sivney,"The sentiment is appreciated, but isn't Soul Destruction a sniper rifle? Those aren't made for engaging in close-ranged combat. You should stay in the back and cover me.",
1189,,Trinity,But… my chance to impress Dr. Sivney…,
1190,,Trinity,"Ahem, I mean, I've cleared the first three stages by myself several times before! I know what I'm doing!",
1191,,Sivney,"Well, if you insist…",
1192,,Bonnie,(Nod nod),
1193,,Sivney,"…Then it shouldn't be too hard for you to aim at different body parts of the monsters so I can observe what their weaknesses are, right?",
1194,,Bonnie,(Chirps in astonishment),
1195,,Trinity,"(Gulps) That is a lot harder than taking them out, but I'll try my best!",
1196,,Trinity,"Target locked. Ready, aim, fire!",
1197,,Shrine Monster,▄▃▂……,
1198,,,(Fizzing sounds),
1199,,Trinity,No signs of tiring yet. Is this because I am with Dr. Sivney now…?,
1200,,Trinity,"Awesome, Dr. Sivney will surely be impressed by how much I've grown!",
1201,,,(Fizzing sounds),
1202,,Shrine Monster,▂▃▄▅——！,
1203,,Trinity,You're right where I want you to be! Take this!,
1204,,Shrine Monster,▄▃▂……,
1205,,,(Fizzing sounds),
1206,,Trinity,"Great job, me!",
1207,,Trinity,"What is that noise…? Is it a trick of my mind, or is it…",
1208,,Shrine Monster,▂▃▅▇——！,
1209,,Trinity,"Oh, you're trying to attack all at once now?",
1210,,Trinity,"Nice plan, but you are no match for me when I'm fully awake!",
1211,,,(Loud fizzing sounds),
1212,,Trinity,Target locked. Full…,
1213,,,(Fizzes and beeps loudly),
1214,,Trinity,…Blast…,
1215,,Trinity,……,
1216,,Shrine Monster,▂▃▅▇——！,
1217,,Sivney,"Alright, stop right there!",
1218,,Sivney,I have no sympathy for brutes like you who try to hurt a sleeping girl in her most vulnerable state…,
1219,,Bonnie,(Chirps angrily),
1220,,Sivney,Time to face your punishment!,
1221,,Shrine Monster,▄▃▂……,
1222,,Trinity,……,
1223,,Sivney,Our Sleeping Beauty slumbers on…,
1224,,Bonnie,(Chirps worriedly),
1225,,Sivney,Let's see...,
1226,,Sivney,"Hm, her Battle Suit and Soul Destruction is still misfunctioning and draining all mana from her.",
1227,,Sivney,"With no other method to replenish mana, sleep may be the best option here.",
1228,,Sivney,"Isn't it, Bonnie?",
1229,,Bonnie,(Chirps in agreement),
1230,Sivney's Approval,Trinity,……,
1231,,Sivney,"I should probably fix her Battle Suit, or it will keep draining her mana.",
1232,,Sivney,…But where’s the fun in working on something that I'm already finished with?,
1233,,Sivney,"Hmm… Can you do it, Bonnie?",
1234,,Bonnie,(Puffs out her chest proudly),
1235,,,……,
1236,,Bonnie,(Chirps dejectedly),
1237,,Sivney,Seriously? You're saying that you can't fix this because some strange adjustments have been made?,
1238,,Sivney,"I thought you were better than that, Bonnie!",
1239,,Bonnie,(Chirps indignantly),
1240,,Sivney,(Sighs) I suppose I have no choice…,
1241,,,Sivney starts to work on Trinity's Gear.,
1242,,Sivney,"Yikes, what happened to my perfectly designed Suit and Weapon?",
1243,,Sivney,"Every module clashes with each other, and the parts don't fit at all. It's a miracle that they're still functional!",
1244,,Sivney,Gear that runs despite the errors…,
1245,,Sivney,There's no way someone without my level of genius can make heads or tails of this mess.,
1246,,Sivney,Hm? This is the power output module…,
1247,,,……,
1248,,Trinity,I…,
1249,,Sivney,"Good morning, Sleeping Beauty.",
1250,,Trinity,"Dr. Sivney! Oh no, did I fall asleep again?",
1251,,Trinity,I've made a fool of myself…,
1252,,Trinity,You must be very disappointed in me…,
1253,,Sivney,Disappointed?,
1254,,Sivney,Did you adjust your equipment yourself?,
1255,,Trinity,"Yes… I did what I could based on the notes you left me, but my skills are mediocre at best…",
1256,,Sivney,"Despite the time you spent studying under me and the aid my notes gave you, you still managed to butcher my perfect invention.",
1257,,Sivney,"If you're looking for praise, you're certainly barking up the wrong tree.",
1258,,Trinity,……,
1259,,Sivney,"My design's energy conversion efficiency was at least at 80%, and now it barely reaches 30%. That's why you're constantly drowzy.",
1260,,Sivney,What were you thinking when you tinkered with the power output module?,
1261,,Trinity,"Be-because… My foes were becoming stronger than ever, and I needed more firepower...",
1262,,Trinity,"I wanted to be of help to the Academy, and had an idea on how to improve my gear…",
1263,,Trinity,"After replacing the heat conductor and increasing the beam energy concentration of the rifle, the performance of the rifle in terms of both range and potency were significantly improved.",
1264,,Sivney,……,
1265,,Trinity,I shouldn't have meddled with your design… I'm so sorry…,
1266,,Sivney,"…Hm, not bad.",
1267,,Trinity,I…,
1268,,Trinity,"… Wait, what?",
1269,,Sivney,"You did make a mess of the whole contraption, but I am quite satisfied with the changes you made to the power output module.",
1270,,Sivney,That bout of genius proves that your time spent with me hasn't gone to waste.,
1271,,Trinity,……,
1272,,Trinity,But… you looked pretty angry…,
1273,,Sivney,"Nah, that was me having fun messing with you.",
1274,,Bonnie,(Giggles),
1275,,Sivney,"You do seem to be gifted in this field. If you would like to further your studies, you can borrow my research notes.",
1276,,Sivney,"If I have time to spare, I might also answer some questions of yours.",
1277,,Trinity,Wow… Am I dreaming?,
9999993,,Teresa,"That ""Trial"" of the Tsuruga Grand Shrine sounds fun… What I wouldn't give for a good fight now!",
1279,,Teresa,"Hmm? What is Mika doing over there, crouched on the ground like that?",
1280,,Teresa,Hello? Mika?,
1281,,Mika,"Huh? Oh, it's you, Teresa.",
1282,,Teresa,What are you doing on the ground? Your hands are covered in mud.,
1283,,,Teresa paused briefly as realization struck her.,
1284,,Teresa,Don't tell me that you're still hung up on what happened in the past.,
1285,,Teresa,It's been years since that happened! Fixating on your past failures is not healthy for you.,
1286,,Mika,…No.,
1287,,Mika,It's not…,
1288,,Mika,The past is set in stone; thinking about it won't change anything.,
1289,,Teresa,"What are you doing then, if not dwelling on the past?",
1290,,,Mika looked at the clay doll held in her hands. She had just finished molding its shape.,
1291,,Mika,… Isn't it cute?,
1292,,,"She paused again, as if searching for the correct words.",
1293,,Mika,I am just… passing the time.,
1294,,Teresa,"Hmph… Sure, if you say so.",
1295,,Teresa,"Though, if I had to choose a way to pass the time, I'd choose drinking. Beats getting your hands all dirty.",
1296,,Teresa,"You're not fooling anyone here, Mika.",
1297,,,"Mika smiled, not denying nor confirming Teresa's accusations.",
1298,,Mika,I envy you sometimes.,
1299,,,"Mika stood up and brushed dust away from her clothes, still holding the clay doll.",
1300,,Mika,"Despite your status as a nun, you are free and unburdened, going where you please whenever you please.",
1301,,Mika,It must be nice to have the freedom to just… be yourself.,
1302,,Teresa,"Um, who else should I be, if not myself?",
1303,,Teresa,"Besides, the Church of Violence isn't that strict.",
1304,,,Teresa munched on a Spicy Fishie as another thought struck her.,
1305,,Teresa,Do you want to try challenging a Trial with me?,
1306,,Mika,A Trial?,
1307,,Teresa,"Yeah, the ones in the Tsuruga Grand Shrine. It's one of the most popular activities for Yume Academy students now.",
1308,,Mika,"I have heard of it; Senpai mentioned it to me the other day. However, my abilities lean towards the defensive instead of the offensive.",
1309,,Mika,I fear that I wouldn't be of much use in these Trials where one has to clear one challenge after another for the prize.,
1310,,Teresa,"Oh, I've heard enough.",
1311,,Teresa,"Physically, you've stopped working on that doll of yours, but mentally you're still stuck, aren't you?",
1312,,Teresa,"You need to get up and start moving. Having too much free time on your hands will only pull you into the depths of self-scrutiny, and you'll never find your way out!",
1313,,Mika,Now that marks the first time I've heard you say anything that remotely represents what a nun might say.,
1314,,Mika,But…,
1315,,Mika,Perhaps you are right.,
1316,,Teresa,"Trust me, I know what I'm doing.",
1317,,Teresa,"You can't stop moving forward. Life is like going upstream; you can either allow yourself to be washed away by the pains of the past, or brave them and move on.",
1318,,Teresa,The best way of stopping your past from getting to you is by overwriting them with new experiences and new memories.,
1319,,Teresa,"That's the secret of my free, unburdened life.",
1320,,Teresa,"Don't go telling everyone else, okay?",
9999992,,Teresa,(Coughs),
1322,,Mika,Are you feeling unwell?,
1323,,Teresa,"(Coughs) The air here is foul, just like that young Shrine Maiden said.",
1324,,,"Teresa waved her hands around, a futile attempt at dispersing the nauseating smoke that permeated the air.",
1325,,Mika,I heard that a large portion of visitors to the Shrine aren't here for religious purposes.,
1326,,Mika,Most have their eyes on the Trial rewards only.,
1327,,Teresa,…Hmm.,
1328,,Teresa,…………,
1329,,Mika,Penny for your thoughts?,
1330,,Teresa,"Nah, I don't charge for that. I was just surprised that the Shrine Maidens actually tolerated these people in their Shrine.",
1331,,Mika,…I see.,
1332,,Teresa,…………,
1333,,Teresa,"… (Sighs) It's none of my business, anyway.",
1334,,Teresa,Let's go!,
1335,,Teresa,"Realm of Trials, here I come!",
1336,,Mika,The enemies here sure look unusual.,
1337,,Teresa,What do they call them again… Monsters? Shrine Monsters?,
1338,,Mika,They were supposed to be spawned from negative emotions.,
1339,,Teresa,Sounds about right.,
1340,,Teresa,"They do look the part, with darkness oozing from every pore.",
1341,,Mika,"If they are truly born from negative emotions, then wouldn't it be better to appease and purify them? We would be doing them a favor for them this way.",
1342,,Teresa,Are you serious?,
1343,,Teresa,The only reason I'm taking on the Trials is for a good fight; I wouldn't be here otherwise.,
1344,,Teresa,"There's no need to waste our efforts on ""comforting"" them when we can just vanquish them!",
1345,,,Teresa brandished her weapon with gusto.,
1346,,Teresa,Why ruin the fun? I've been looking forward to unleashing carnage on these abominations!,
1347,,,"The Nun's eyes gleamed with a wild, primal light as she spoke excitedly.",
1348,,Mika,"(A true nun of the Church of Violence, turning to violence no matter the circumstances.)",
1349,,Shrine Monster,▄▇▄……▄▇▄……,
1350,,,"A Shrine Monster snuck up on Mika when she was lost in thought and was about to strike her down. Luckily, Teresa blocked the blow before it landed.",
1351,,Teresa,"Oi, keep your head in the game. I brought you here so you can get out of your head, not for you to get stuck deeper in it.",
1352,,Mika,S-sorry…,
1353,,Teresa,Get a grip on yourself!,
1354,,Mika,……,
1355,,Teresa,You can choose to live in the present and live every moment to the fullest… Or to live in the past and be devoured by your past demons.,
1356,,,Teresa said forcefully as she slashed and hacked at the waves of Monsters rushing at them.,
1357,,Mika,……,
1358,,Teresa,"Personally, I would prefer the former instead of the latter!",
1359,,,"Every hit of Teresa's struck true, and the Monster wailed before shattering into pieces.",
1360,,,The remains of the Monsters were dark as ink and left black stains on the walls and floorboards of the Shrine.,
1361,,Mika,(Is this why you believe in violence so much…?),
999991,,Teresa,Phew…,
1363,,Teresa,"Good work, partner!",
1364,,,Teresa grinned widely and patted Mika's shoulder.,
1365,,Mika,"If it wasn't for you, that last wave of Monsters would have…",
1366,,Teresa,Don't worry about it!,
1367,,Teresa,We deserve a break after all that fighting. I would kill for a nice keg of beer now…,
1368,,,"Teresa sat cross-legged on the floor, looking comfortable.",
1369,,Mika,……,
1370,,Teresa,What's on your mind? You look troubled again.,
1371,,,"Mika stood tensely in front of Teresa, worried about what she was about to say.",
1372,,Mika,But… Swinging your sword around and exhausting yourself with excitement... Isn't that the same as avoiding the problem?,
1373,,Teresa,What?,
1374,,Mika,Can one truly move on from their past demons while living like this?,
1375,,Mika,"If we do not address the problems, if excitement is all we live for…",
1376,,,"The former Swordmaster gazed intently at her teammate, frowning.",
1377,,Mika,… Aren't we just averting our eyes from them?,
1378,,Mika,"Our past is a part of us, and no matter how far we go… It will eventually catch up with us.",
1379,,,Teresa's eyes widened in astonishment. What Mika said contradicted what she believed for the main part of her life.,
1380,,Teresa,"Averting our eyes, you say?",
1381,,,This was the first time her core beliefs have been described that way.,
1382,,Teresa,…Running away?,
1383,,Teresa,……,
1384,,,"A long, long time has passed since Teresa started to live her life like the protagonist of a movie.",
1385,,,"She crammed one exhilarating event after another into her life to escape from her past demons,",
1386,,,but they always catch up when she stops for a break.,
1387,,,"The only thing she could do was to lengthen the time in between breaks to the best of her abilities, which exhausted her.",
1388,,Teresa,…What other choice do I have?,
1389,,,Teresa snorted.,
1390,,Teresa,Should I take a page from your book and hold onto a clay doll like a lifeline? Has it made you feel any better?,
1391,,Mika,……,
1392,,Shrine Monster,▄▇▄……▄▇▄……,
1393,,Mika,"I don't know what happened to you, Teresa, but…",
1394,,Shrine Monster,▄▇▄……▄▇▄……,
1395,,Teresa,！,
1396,,Teresa,Behind you!,
1397,,,Teresa pulled Mika away from the dark shadow and slashed it into pieces.,
1398,,Teresa,Break time is over!,
1399,,,……,
1400,,Teresa,"Hah, is this all the Tsuruga Grand Shrine's ominous ""Trials"" have to offer?",
1401,,Teresa,Pathetic.,
1402,,Shrine Monster,Te…re…,
1403,,Shrine Monster,▄▇▄……▄▇▄……,
1404,,Teresa,……,
1405,,Mika,Are they… speaking to you?,
1406,,Shrine Monster,Tere……▄▇▄……sa……▄▇▄……,
1407,,Teresa,"Ugh, you're making my head hurt.",
1408,,Mika,Teresa? Are they saying your name?,
1409,,Teresa,Shut up. Shut up!!,
1410,,,"Frustrated by their wails, Teresa flew into a rage and her slashes became more forceful.",
1362,Demons from the Past,Teresa,Phew…,
1321,To Heart's Content,Teresa,(Coughs),
1278,Secret to Living Freely,Teresa,"That ""Trial"" of the Tsuruga Grand Shrine sounds fun… What I wouldn't give for a good fight now!",
