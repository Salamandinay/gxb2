1,Prologue,,Rumors of the Tsuruga Grand Shrine traveled far and wide across the land.,
2,,,"Word goes that a God laid down the foundations for the trial grounds there, and whoever had the skills (or luck) to pass the trials will be rewarded with precious artifacts, crafted by the Gods themselves.",
3,,*,"Every minute of careful planning leads up to this moment! Tsuruga Grand Shrine, be prepared for the greatness that is me!",
4,,,A Shrine Maiden paused sweeping and glared at me.,
5,,Shrine Maiden,"Ugh, outsiders who have no respect for the trials nor for the Shrine, undermining the danger with eyes only on the ultimate prize. Do you mind moving a bit? I'm trying to sweep here.",
6,,*,"Oops, moving now. Though I have to assure you, I am confident that my team and I will pass the fabled trials!",
7,,Shrine Maiden,"I've heard this spoken countless times. Few actually followed through. Anyways, I should be getting back to my duties, so good luck out there.",
8,,*,"Aww, that's so nice of you, Miss. If you are also in the mood to impart wisdom on how to clear the trials, I'd be all ears.",
9,,Shrine Maiden,The only advice I will be giving you today is to go home. You'd at least leave with all your limbs intact.,
10,,*,"Nope, that's not an option. So, since helpful words are out of the picture, maybe some helpful charms and talismans...?",
11,,Shrine Maiden,"Even if there was one, it's bold of you to assume that I'd be handing them out freely. Since you have already made up your mind, then there's nothing I can say or do to help. As I said before, good luck.",
12,,Shrine Maiden,"...If Chizuko was here, she would have tried her best to convince you to leave. But she doesn't understand that bullheaded folks like you just won't change your minds like that...",
13,,*,"Thank you! By the way, who's this Chizuko person you're talking about...?",
14,,Shrine Maiden,"Don't even think about it. Chizuko is kind, adorable, and way out of your league.",
15,,*,She sounds nice and friendly! I will definitely try to befriend her after I pass the trials.,
16,,Shrine Maiden,"Ugh, you're hopeless. Now scram and stop getting in the way.",
17,,*,"See you later! ...Treasure, treasure, here I come~",
18,New Friends?,*,"I'm tired. Exhausted. This patch of ground is nice and comfortable, and I don't want to move.",
19,,Uriel,"Well done, Senpai! We have gathered a bunch of Origami Cranes. This should be enough for a reward from the Pond of Prayers.",
20,,*,"Ooh, a reward! I suddenly feel much more motivated to get up now. Goodbye, comfortable patch of earth.",
21,,,A very familiar Shrine Maiden swept her broom over my feet. Rude.,
22,,Shrine Maiden,"Ugh, you again...is this the ""team"" you mentioned last time?",
23,,Uriel,"Good day, Miss. My name is Uriel.",
24,,*,"I'm so glad to see you again! As you may have guessed, I passed the trials! With all my limbs intact, no less!",
25,,*,"Look, I even got the Origami Cranes to prove it!",
26,,Shrine Maiden,"Hmph, those are authentic ""Symbols of Approval"". I'm surprised that you actually passed the trials. Or did this lady do all the work for you?",
27,,Uriel,"Oh no, I can't take all the credit. Senpai pulled his weight in the trial.",
28,,*,"Hear, hear!",
29,,Shrine Maiden,Good.\nWhy are you standing in the way? The Pond of Prayers is that way.,
30,,*,"My bad, my bad.",
31,,*,"I'm *, by the way. Do you mind telling me your name? I can't always call you ""Miss"", and we're probably going to see each other again.",
32,,Mami,...It's Mami.,
33,,Mami,……,
34,,Mami,...Do you need anything else?,
35,,KongMing,"Senpai, Uriel.",
36,,KongMing,"Instead of clearing the trials and collecting treasure for the Academy like the others, I have a different mission for you. Multiple missions, to be exact.",
37,,Ithil,"*, aside from passing the trials, you will be infiltrating the Shrine, befriending the Shrine Maidens and Priestesses.",
38,,Ithil,"When you have done so, you will try your best to uncover the secrets of the Shrine, especially the source of the treasures.",
39,,KongMing,"The treasures are effective when fighting against Chaos, and any information about them would benefit us greatly.",
40,,KongMing,"Uriel, you are in charge of Senpai's safety. Shady characters have been reported to visit the Shrine, and asking around may draw unwanted attention to Senpai.",
41,,Uriel,I swear on my Shield and my honor as a Knight that I will not allow any harm to befall Senpai.,
42,,*,"Knowledge, maybe? I'd like to learn more about your Shrine.",
43,,*,"The God that this Shrine is dedicated to, the origins of the trials, the history of the treasures, that sort of thing. Since you work here, you must know a lot about this Shrine, right? Please?",
44,,Mami,"Huh, that's new.",
45,,Mami,Most just take the treasure and leave. Not many people want to learn about our Shrine.,
46,,*,"Yes, that's me, always eager to learn! So please? Pretty please? With cherries and ice cream and marshmallows on top?",
47,,Mami,I'm starting to think you are looking for diabetes instead of knowledge.,
48,,*,"Aww, you shouldn't insult my eating habits before you try it yourself. I know this really good cake place...",
49,,Mami,"Thanks, but no thanks.",
50,,Mami,"I'm not an expert in story-telling, so you're barking up the wrong tree if it truly is knowledge that you're seeking.",
51,,Mami,"Visit the Shrine Office at nightfall: Ms. Mizue will be recounting the history of the Shrine, as well as past legends to the younger Shrine Maidens. They wouldn't mind anyone joining them.",
52,,Mami,"However, don't even think about disturbing them, or I will hunt you down personally and murder you with this broom. Are we clear?",
53,,*,"Aww, you wound me with your suspicions.",
54,,Mami,It's always beneficial to be cautious. Who knows what shady businesses you outsiders are up to?,
55,,Mami,"Now, if you will excuse me, I need to get back to sweeping.",
56,,*,...(Puppy eyes),
57,,Mami,...What.,
58,,*,"You mentioned a girl named Chizuko last time, right?",
59,,Mami,？！,
60,,*,"Do you think I can meet her? I mean, a friend of yours is a friend of mine! Right?",
61,,Mami,Get. Out.,
62,Story Night,Uriel,"Senpai, what happened? You were so hyper before, and now you're just…wallowing in misery.",
63,,*,"Nothing big, just a bit miffed that Mami doesn't seem to trust me. Especially after everything we've been through together!",
64,,Uriel,"...You've had a grand total of two conversations with her, Senpai. I think you should give her more time.",
65,,*,"You're right, she must be taken aback by my overflowing friendliness. She probably needs more time to get used to me. Hey, is that the Shrine Office up ahead?",
66,,,Not too far away young Shrine Maidens can be seen sitting on stools and listening attentively to an elderly Priestess.,
67,,Uriel,"Looks like we're just in time. Unfortunately, all seats are taken, so we must stand for the entirety of the session.",
68,,？？？,(Pushes two spare stools forward),
69,,*,"Thank you, dearie.",
70,,？？？,……,
71,,Uriel,She seems like a shy kid.,
72,,*,"Well, yet another mystery to the mix. Let's just listen to what Ms. Mizue has to say first so we can bring some information back to KongMing and Ithil.",
73,,Mizue,"Now, can anyone tell me what did we cover last time?",
74,,？？？,"(Raises hand) You said that the land upon which our Shrine is built used to be wide, fertile plains, and that crops grew without being cultivated!",
75,,Mizue,"Excellent! Well done, Chizuko.",
76,,Chizuko,Hurray!,
77,,*,"(Ah, this must be the Chizuko girl Mami mentioned. She is as adorable as I imagined.)",
78,,Mizue,"Before the Tsuruga Grand Shrine was established, this region was called Sawagi, meaning ""moist and plentiful lands"".",
79,,Mizue,"Sawagi, as Chizuko mentioned, was a wide and fertile terrain. Trees bore fruit overnight, and its habitants never worried about starving.",
80,,Mizue,Everything changed when two monsters arrived.,
81,,Mizue,"They were brothers: the older brother was named Ao Oni, while the younger brother called itself Aka Oni. Ao Oni drew in rain clouds and flooded rivers and lakes when it cried; Aka Oni brought about droughts when it laughed.",
82,,Mizue,"They came from the Tsuyuoka region, where they caused mischief.",
83,,Mizue,"The people of Tsuyuoka had the ability to communicate with Gods. When the brothers were too much to bear with, they plead to the Gods to stop the brothers.",
84,,Mizue,"The Gods heard the prayers. They descended to the mortal world and beheaded the brothers. However, they were no ordinary monsters and could survive even with their heads separated from their bodies.",
85,,Mizue,The brothers fled Tsuyuoka with their heads when the Gods were taken unawares.,
86,,Mizue,"Ao Oni and Aka Oni traveled across the world, suffering from hunger and the cold in search of another place to settle down. When they reached Sawagi, they were bitter about what they have experienced and were jealous of the Sawagi people who lived happy and carefree lives.",
87,,Mizue,"They robbed the people, moving into the most luxurious house in the region, and will only be appeased with annual offerings of treasure, food, and a young girl. Unlike the people of Tsuyuoka, the people of Sawagi couldn't communicate with the Gods, and any efforts to rebel against their oppression were met with a swift and bloody end. They had no choice but to comply with the brothers' requests.",
88,,Mizue,"The two monsters thrived with the yearly offerings. The sacrifice was killed in cold blood, and huge bonfires were raised to burn the body.",
89,,Mizue,"Much to Aka Oni's displeasure, the people of Sawagi didn't fall into poverty as it expected, thanks to the fertile soil of the region.",
90,,Mizue,"It wanted them to suffer as itself and its brother did on the travels, so it started to laugh every day, bringing droughts to the land.",
91,,Mizue,"The soil gradually became barren as Aka Oni's laughs boomed across the land on a daily basis, and crops stopped growing despite the best efforts of the Sawagi people.",
92,,Mizue,"The yearly demands of food became impossible to fulfill, but Aka Oni showed no mercy. It tortured the people when it didn't get what it wanted.",
93,,Mizue,Aka Oni finally achieved its dreams of seeing the inhabitants of Sawagi suffer as it did.,
94,,Mizue,"When all seemed bleak, Enbi no Mikoto, a brave young woman and our savior, decided to stand against Aka Oni and end its ""rule"".",
95,,Mizue,"She wanted Sawagi to return to what it was before the brothers arrived and reasoned that the only way to achieve this was to slay Aka Oni, who brought about all the droughts.",
96,,Mizue,...And that's all for today. You will learn more about Enbi no Mikoto and what she did tomorrow.,
97,,Uriel,"I wonder whether Enbi no Mikoto succeeded in killing the monster. Since she is called ""the Savior"", then she probably did.",
98,,*,"It's likely. Or maybe she failed, but her sacrifice urged the Sawagi people to rebel against the brothers, like a symbol.",
99,,Uriel,I hope not. It's not a befitting ending for someone like her.,
100,,Uriel,"The sun should shine bright in the sky, not dragged down to the depths of the underworld.",
101,,*,Who knows? It's all speculation at this point.,
102,,*,"We should come back tomorrow; I'd like to learn something about the Pond of Prayers, and you can find out what happened to Enbi no Mikoto.",
103,Crossing Paths,Chizuko,(Hums a merry tune),
104,,Uriel,She looks familiar.,
105,,*,"Wait, I think I know who she is...you're Chizuko, right?",
106,,Chizuko,"Oh, yes! But why do you know my name?",
107,,*,"I'm *, and this is Uriel. We were there yesterday at Ms. Mizue's lecture.",
108,,*,"And I've chatted with Mami, who says that you're kind and adorable.",
109,,Chizuko,"Oooh, really?",
110,,Chizuko,"I don't know I should be mortified that she talks about me to total strangers, or be delighted that she does.",
111,,*,"I'd go with delighted. I mean, she surely thinks highly of you.",
112,,*,"I can't say the same for myself though, seeing how she always looks irritated when I'm around.",
113,,Chizuko,"Yes, that sounds like Mami. She's very protective of us, you see. There was an incident where an outsider tried to kidnap a Shrine Maiden for the secrets of our Shrine.",
114,,Chizuko,"Thankfully, Mami chased him out before he succeeded, or we would be in great trouble. She's been wary of outsiders ever since.",
115,,Chizuko,At least she hasn't chased you out with her broom yet. I think that means you're okay in her books.,
116,,*,(But she treats me like dirt...literally. With her sweeping broom.),
117,,Chizuko,"I'm still a Shrine-Maiden-in-training for now, but I want to be like Mami in the future.",
118,,Chizuko,"She is warm, caring, skillful, and just the best big sister anyone can ask for!",
119,,Uriel,"Speaking of this, I'm wondering why the Shrine allowed the rumors to spread.",
120,,Uriel,Wouldn't it be a lot safer for you without having to deal with the Outsiders coming and going every day for the treasure?,
121,,Chizuko,I don't think we can stop the rumors even if we wanted to; everyone must have heard of them by now!,
122,,Chizuko,"Besides, our Senior Priestess said that it is vital to have outsiders participating in the trials instead of just us Shrine Maidens.",
123,,Chizuko,"Seeing how the trials are...you know what, you should join us again tonight. I'm sure Ms. Mizue will cover this in her narration.",
124,,*,Not even a spoiler?,
125,,Chizuko,Nope! You don't see people who are actually interested in the Shrine every day. Most are just here for the trial and the treasure.,
126,,Chizuko,"Us Shrine Maidens are responsible for passing down knowledge and traditions, so that's what I'm doing!",
127,,Uriel,Of course. We still haven't found out whether Enbi no Mikoto managed to defeat the Aka Oni or not.,
128,,Chizuko,"As I said, no spoilers!",
129,,Chizuko,"Enbi no Mikoto is one of the people that I admire a lot, and I like her legend a lot. I can't ruin the experience of hearing her tale for you.",
130,,Chizuko,"Oops, duty calls. See you later~",
131,,*,"Judging from her tone, I think Enbi no Mikoto succeeded, or else she wouldn't be so enthusiastic.",
132,,Uriel,I sure hope so.,
133,,*,It's time for us to head back to the trials anyway; we need to gather more Origami Cranes to exchange treasure with.,
134,,*,"Or should I say ""Symbols of Approval""? That's what Mami called them, right?",
135,,,……,
136,,？？？,"Too much time has passed since I've left. What do they call this place now...Sawagi? No, no, it's Tsuruga, the name of the Shrine.",
137,,？？？,"Too many demons lurk in the shadows, too much pain and despair threaten to consume me wherever I went, so I fled...",
138,,？？？,"But now everything has changed, and the Tsuruga Grand Shrine is only a shadow of its former glory.",
139,,？？？,"If we haven't hesitated that night and sought refuge in the Shrine…we would have changed our fates, wouldn't we?",
140,,Izanami,"I wouldn't have been infected by Chaos, and you would never have left me behind…",
141,,Izanami,"Where are you now, Isanagi?",
142,,Izanami,Have you ever returned to this land that we once called home?,
143,,Uriel,Senpai?,
144,,*,I think I saw someone familiar...but she was gone when I blinked.,
145,,Uriel,Perhaps another student from the Academy? We're not the only ones KongMing and Ithil sent.,
146,,*,"I'm not sure...maybe I'm just imagining things. Anyways, we have a trial to clear. Let's do that.",
147,Story Night…Again,Uriel,"Senpai, Senpai, over here! Ms. Mizue is just about to start!",
148,,*,"Coming! You are really invested in this story now, Uriel.",
149,,Uriel,I'm afraid I won't be able to sleep soundly without knowing the end of this tale.,
150,,Uriel,I wonder if Chizuko made it... I can't find her with everyone wearing the same Shrine Maiden uniforms.,
151,,Mizue,"... Enbi no Mikoto, who decided to rebel against Aka Oni, donned a red dress and hid a sharpened machete among its folds.",
152,,Mizue,She pretended to yield to the two brothers and was taken into their residence as a servant.,
153,,Mizue,"Aka Oni and Ao Oni were satisfied with her service and gradually trusted her with more household chores, granting her access to their private space whenever she saw fit.",
154,,Mizue,"During this time, she read about the origins of the two brothers in their library.",
155,,Mizue,"She also found a painting stuck to a scarecrow that the brothers often beat up in anger. While she didn't understand its significance, she memorized every detail of the painting.",
156,,Mizue,"One night, when Aka Oni was fast asleep, Enbi no Mikoto grasped her trusty machete and entered its quarters.",
157,,Mizue,"In one firm slash, Aka Oni's head was separated from its body.",
158,,Mizue,"Enbi no Mikoto turned to leave immediately but stopped in her tracks as she remembered the scars on the necks of the brothers, as well as the fact that despite being beheaded by the Gods before, they still lived.",
159,,Mizue,"Before leaving the room, she set the scarecrow's head on the decapitated body of Aka Oni, covered it with a thick quilt, and hid Aka Oni's head in the folds of her dress.",
160,,Mizue,"Ao Oni, who was out earlier that night, saw her exit Aka Oni's room. It asked: ""Was your dress always this red?""",
161,,Mizue,"Enbi no Mikoto feigned calmness: ""Yes, I've always worn a red dress.""",
162,,Mizue,Ao Oni didn't notice any evidence of foul play under the dim lights of the night and allowed Enbi no Mikoto to leave with its brother's head.,
163,,Uriel,Yesssss!,
164,,,"Everyone turned to Uriel, who shouted in triumph.",
165,,*,(Whispers) Shush! You're interrupting the story.,
166,,Uriel,I apologize for the disruption.,
167,,Chizuko,(Yells) YESSSSS!,
168,,,"Another yell, this time from Chizuko, drew attention to herself.",
169,,*,"Huh, Chizuko shouted too. At least you're not the only one now.",
170,,Chizuko,Enbi no Mikoto escaped unscathed after slaying the horrendous monster. This is my favorite part of the story!,
171,,Mizue,I know. Your excitement when we arrive at this point of the story sure hasn't dimmed a bit despite how many times you have heard it.,
172,,Mizue,"While it is nice to express your adoration of Enbi no Mikoto verbally, it is stopping me from proceeding with the tale.",
173,,Chizuko,"Whoops. This won't happen again, I promise! I'll shout quietly next time! In my mind!",
174,,Uriel,(Whispers) Me too. This won't happen again.,
175,,Mizue,"... As I was saying, Enbi no Mikoto left the brothers' residence with Aka Oni's head. The people of Sawagi were overjoyed at the announcement that the menace was gone for good.",
176,,Mizue,"Together, they burned Aka Oni's head to ashes, believing that the much-loathed droughts will not harm Sawagi again.",
177,,Mizue,"As Ao Oni didn't share Aka Oni's enthusiasm in torturing the people of Sawagi, they didn't suffer as much with Aka Oni out of the picture.",
178,,Mizue,"Although life in Sawagi was still a far cry from what it was, the people were content with what they managed to achieve.",
179,,Mizue,"During this time, Ao Oni believed that Aka Oni was simply asleep from exhaustion. However, it grew worried when its brother never woke up.",
180,,Mizue,"It flung the quilt off Aka Oni's bed, prepared to ask why Aka Oni was resting for such a long time, but the question died on its tongue as it saw its brother's beheaded body. All that remained in the place of the head was a bunch of hay.",
181,,Mizue,"Ao Oni rushed out of the room. As the brothers were connected by blood, it was able to locate Aka Oni's head with their link. Much to its dismay, it was led to a pile of ashes, indicating Aka Oni's fate.",
182,,Mizue,"While they were immortal, regenerating their bodies will take months, even years.",
183,,Mizue,"Ao Oni sobbed uncontrollably as it realized that it will be parted with its brother for a long, long time.",
184,,Mizue,"Ao Oni's tears drew in heavy rain clouds, and Sawagi suffered from the downpour that ensued.",
185,,Mizue,"The rivers overflowed, submerging the farmlands in floodwaters and robbing them of the ability to grow crops. What's worse, the floodwaters brought about pests and plague as well.",
186,,Mizue,"The Sawagi people, who had just started to settle down again, started to panic, and plead Ao Oni to spare them.",
187,,Mizue,Ao Oni promised to cease the endless rain in exchange for the murderer of its brother.,
188,,Mizue,They did not hesitate to sell Enbi no Mikoto out and delivered her to the hands of Ao Oni to appease it.,
189,,Mizue,... And that's all for today. We'll delve further into the story and into the fate of Enbi no Mikoto tomorrow. I'd be glad to see you join us tomorrow too.,
190,,*,"Thank you, we'd be honored to.",
191,,*,"I can't believe the nerve of these people, turning their backs to Enbi no Mikoto like that. Don't you agree, Uriel... Uriel?",
192,,Uriel,This... this isn't right...,
193,Cranes,Uriel,……,
194,,Chizuko,……,
195,,*,Are you okay? Your eyes are swollen and puffy.,
196,,Chizuko,It's just... I couldn't get the story out of my head and cried myself to sleep last night.,
197,,Uriel,I feel the same.,
198,,*,"I thought you knew what happened to Enbi no Mikoto, Chizuko.",
199,,Chizuko,I do! It's just hard to not be saddened by this part of the story despite having heard it recited countless times…but I probably should pull myself together in front of guests. (Takes several deep breaths),
200,,Chizuko,"... Whew! There, a lot better!",
201,,Chizuko,"So, will the both of you be joining us again tonight?",
202,,Uriel,"Of course! I have faith in Enbi no Mikoto; a strong woman like her wouldn't be stopped by hardships like this one, despite how daunting it seems.",
203,,Chizuko,"Hmm... I'd hate to spoil the experience of hearing this story for the first time,",
204,,Chizuko,"but I can assure you that no, this is not the end of her story.",
205,,Chizuko,I think we will reach the climax of the story today. I can't wait!,
206,,*,That's good to hear. Uriel can finally stop being so nervous and fidgety.,
207,,Uriel,Senpai! (Blushes),
208,,Chizuko,"By the way, where did you come from? I keep forgetting to ask...",
209,,*,"We're from Yume Academy, and I'm her Senpai. Well, I'm the Senpai of almost everyone in the Academy.",
210,,Chizuko,Yume Academy? Is it far away from here?,
211,,Uriel,It's located south of the Wastelands of Foehn.,
212,,Chizuko,The Wastelands of Foehn... I think I read about it before. And you're from further away than that? Wow!,
213,,*,It would have taken us forever to arrive here if the Academy didn't provide us with some high-tech vehicles.,
214,,Chizuko,Oh! Have you seen cranes on your way here? I've never seen one before!,
215,,Uriel,"Cranes? As in, the bird?",
216,,Chizuko,"Yes! In fact, the Tsuruga Grand Shrine is named after the cranes! Well, the word for crane in the local tongue, that is.",
217,,*,"I don't understand... if the shrine is named after them, then shouldn't they be fairly ordinary here?",
218,,Chizuko,"Nope! We don't have cranes here. They are mythical creatures, you see, that only appear when the Gods descend to earth. According to legends, they are servants of God.",
219,,Chizuko,"We've only seen paintings depicting them, but never in real life. Many of us believed that they only exist in stories and tales.",
220,,Chizuko,"It isn't until we heard outsiders talking about them that we knew that they are real, living creatures.",
221,,Uriel,"Well, that's not the case from where we came from. While they aren't too common, some can be found if you're in the right place at the right time. As a matter of fact, I've seen some from afar before.",
222,,Chizuko,Woah! Do they really have black and white feathers with a streak of red on their heads? Do they look as elegant as the ancient scrolls say?,
223,,*,"I've never read your scrolls, so I'm not sure about the elegant part, but yes, that sounds like the cranes I've seen.",
224,,Chizuko,"Just as the scrolls and tomes said! Cranes must have lived in the region before, or our predecessors wouldn't have drawn them this accurately.",
225,,Chizuko,"I hope I can see one myself one day! Did I tell you that one of my dreams is touching the feathers of a crane? I'm named after them, you see, and they're my favorite!",
226,,,"Chizuko was brimming with excitement at learning more about cranes when a passerby crashed into her, causing her to fall to the ground with a yelp.",
227,,？？？,"Tch. Get out of my way, brat.",
228,,Uriel,How rude! Come back here and apologize to Chizuko!,
229,,*,"(I have a bad feeling about that person, but... I should help Chizuko now. This can wait.)",
230,,*,"Are you alright, Chizuko? Here, I'll help you up.",
231,,Chizuko,"Thank you! I'm just taken unawares. Look, not even a scratch!",
232,,Uriel,I memorized what he wore. I can drag him back here so he can apologize properly.,
233,,Chizuko,"Oh no, you don't have to do that! I'm glad that you care, but I think it's partially my fault too; I wasn't paying attention to my surroundings.",
234,,Chizuko,"Besides, he's gone for a while and he was wearing the uniform of his team. I don't think we can catch up to him or single him out from his team.",
235,,？？？,"I heard the commotion. What happened, Chizuko?",
236,,Chizuko,"Senior Priestess Kugatsu! Someone ran into me, and my friends here want them to apologize properly, that's all.",
237,,Senior Priestess,(Shakes head) These outsiders are getting out of line. I'll send them a warning.,
238,,Senior Priestess,And you are?,
239,,*,"Hello! I am *, and this is Uriel.",
240,,Kugatsu,"Good day. I am Kugatsu, Senior Priestess of the Tsuruga Grand Shrine.",
241,,Chizuko,"Senior Priestess, * and Uriel weren't trying to disrupt the order or mean harm to the shrine. I can vouch for them!",
242,,Kugatsu,"Don't worry, I'm not here to harass your friends.",
243,,Kugatsu,"Although if memory serves me right, you are supposed to be helping with preparing the ceremony.",
244,,Chizuko,"Whoops, it's time to get back to work already? I'll start right away, Senior Priestess.",
245,(Yet Another) Story Night,Mizue,"... Enbi no Mikoto was betrayed by the Sawagi people, who handed her over to Ao Oni to appease its anger.",
246,,Mizue,"As Aka Oni's head was burnt to ashes, Ao Oni wanted Enbi no Mikoto to suffer the same fate. It built a large pyre to ensure Enbi no Mikoto will not survive.",
247,,Mizue,"Their foul deed did not change Enbi no Mikoto's devotion of protecting the people, so she walked willingly to the blazing fires.",
248,,Mizue,"As she gazed at the flames, she was reminded of the painting that the brothers seemed to be averse to.",
249,,,"All the other Shrine Maidens, including Chizuko, joined Ms. Mizue in reciting the story.",
250,,Shrine Maidens,Enbi no Mikoto had a revelation regarding the scene on the painting: it was an ancient and primal memory of the ancestors of Sawagi.,
251,,Shrine Maidens,"The painting depicted figures of dancers amid the tendrils of fire. Following their stances, Enbi no Mikoto started to dance as well.",
252,,Shrine Maidens,It was close to impossible to tell that this was her first time going through this routine; the moves were smooth and graceful as she twisted and twirled unscathed in the flames meant to harm her.,
253,,Shrine Maidens,"All of a sudden, the sounds of birds flapping their wings could be heard, and a flock of black, white, and red birds appeared on the horizon.",
254,,Shrine Maidens,"They were cranes, and the flapping of their wings dispersed the rainclouds that Ao Oni summoned.",
255,,Shrine Maidens,"Homura-Ōmikami, the God watching over us all, sat among the cranes and rescued Enbi no Mikoto from the fire.",
256,,Shrine Maidens,"The people of Sawagi raised their heads in wonder, watching the first God to ever descend to the Sawagi lands, cradling Enbi no Mikoto in Their arms.",
257,,Shrine Maidens,The dance of Enbi no Mikoto gradually became the practice we call Kagura dance today.,
258,,Mizue,"Well, it's good to know that you haven't forgotten your heritage.",
259,,*,(Whispers) Just how many times have they heard this story to have it memorized down to every word??,
260,,Mizue,"Ao Oni was beyond frightened when Enbi no Mikoto began to dance, and rushed towards the ignited pyre.",
261,,Mizue,"Much to its astonishment, the flames intending to take Enbi no Mikoto's life stopped its steps, and it couldn't get close to the dancing girl.",
262,,Mizue,"Ao Oni forced itself to shed tears, summoning more rainclouds, but the rain failed to put out the fires.",
263,,Mizue,"It had no choice but to wait for Enbi no Mikoto to finish her dance, sealing its fate by summoning Homura-Ōmikami.",
264,,Mizue,"The battle between Homura-Ōmikami and Ao Oni lasted for seven days and seven nights. While Ao Oni had no power against Homura-Ōmikami, it had regeneration powers and fled whenever it could.",
265,,Mizue,"In the end, Homura-Ōmikami called upon the powers of the sun, and Ao Oni was reduced to ashes.",
266,,Mizue,"Unfortunately, Ao Oni's death didn't restore the ruined lands of Sawagi, where no crops could ever grow again.",
267,,Mizue,The Sawagi people prayed to Homura-Ōmikami to make the earth fertile again for the crops to grow. Enbi no Mikoto prayed as well.,
268,,Mizue,"Moved by Enbi no Mikoto's pleas, Homura-Ōmikami ordered the cranes to fly across Sawagi, bringing life back to the land.",
269,,Mizue,"However, the deeds of the Sawagi people couldn't go unpunished.",
270,,Mizue,"The farmlands of Sawagi never returned to their former fertility, and the people had to work diligently to feed themselves.",
271,,Mizue,"Before Homura-Ōmikami returned to the heavens, They ordered Enbi no Mikoto to build a shrine for Them.",
272,,Mizue,"Enbi no Mikoto named the shrine Tsuruga, after the cranes that were servants of the Deity.",
273,,Mizue,... And this is how the Tsuruga Grand Shrine came into being.,
274,,Uriel,Whew! I'm glad that everything turned out okay for Enbi no Mikoto.,
275,,*,"To be honest, I was expecting to learn more about the trials.",
276,,Uriel,Now that you mention it...,
277,,,Ms. Mizue walked towards us as if she had overheard our conversation.,
278,,Mizue,"Homura-Ōmikami may have defeated Ao Oni, but the brothers were immortal, and the danger still existed.",
279,,Mizue,Come back again tomorrow; the story is far from over yet.,
280,,*,We will.,
281,,,……,
282,,Izanami,"We used to walk under the moonlight, holding hands all the while... but you're not here now, Isanagi.",
283,,Izanami,There was no trace of you ever having returned; why did you stay away? Have you forgotten all about me? About us?,
284,,Izanami,"I will find you, Isanagi... No matter where you have gone.",
285,,Athena,Isanami!,
286,,Izanami,... Athena. This better be important.,
287,,Athena,I have a message from Kratos. She heard that Yume Academy sent students here to the Tsuruga Grand Shrine. Since you're already here...,
288,,Izanami,I am only here to seek Izanagi. This was our homeland; I will not taint the fond memories I have of this place.,
289,,Athena,But Kratos ordered...,
290,,Izanami,Enough. Just tell her what I said. I am not obliged to follow her orders.,
291,,Izanami,"For your safety, I would suggest not taking any rash actions when you're in the Shrine. It is not unguarded.",
292,,Athena,... As you wish. I have another report to make: I discovered traces of Chaos activity here. I suspect it has already infiltrated the shrine.,
293,,Izanami,Chaos!,
294,,Izanami,I understand. If the Chaos have the misfortune of running into me... I will end them.,
295,,Izanami,"... I hear footsteps. We will be getting company soon. If there are no more reports, I will be taking my leave.",
296,,Athena,"That was the last. I wish you well, Izanami.",
297,,*,……？,
298,,Uriel,What will happen next? I hope Enbi no Mikoto lived happily ever after in the end.,
299,,Uriel,... Senpai? Senpai? Have you been listening to anything I said in the last minute?,
300,,*,"I'm sorry, Uriel, but I swear I saw the same person several days ago. I can't seem to remember her identity though.",
301,Names,Chizuko,"*, over here~",
302,,Chizuko,What brings you here today? And where's Uriel?,
303,,*,"Ah, she's still asleep. Apparently, she was up all night being excited for Enbi no Mikoto and only fell asleep at sunrise, so it's just me today. What are you doing?",
304,,Chizuko,We're preparing for the Ceremony! It will be held at night three days later. Will you be there?,
305,,*,I wouldn't miss it for anything! I'll tell Uriel about this too. What happens at this Ceremony?,
306,,Chizuko,"It's a huge event! It's more like a Festival, now that I think about it: Food Stalls, Game Stalls... And we would also be having a Kagura Dance Performance!",
307,,Chizuko,"Us Shrine Maidens tried to follow the historical texts as best as possible, but it's probably not the same routine that Enbi no Mikoto went through. I can guarantee you that it's still amazing though!",
308,,Chizuko,"I've always wanted to perform, but I can't since I'm not an official Shrine Maiden yet. That, and I need a lot more practice before I'm deemed worthy!",
309,,*,I'm sure you will be able to sometime soon. I can't wait to see you on stage!,
310,,Chizuko,"Thank you! By the way, you said you know Mami, right? Look, there she is!",
311,,,"As I turned towards the direction Chizuko was gesturing to, I saw Mami, Ms. Mizue, Senior Priestess Kugatsu, and the young shrine maiden who saved us seats during the lecture.",
312,,,"Suddenly, my eyes met with Mami's cautious ones. Her expression soured.",
313,,*,"Oh no, Mami wouldn't be happy with me for befriending Chizuko...",
314,,Mami,"Chizuko, what are you doing with this imbecile?",
315,,*,"Ouch, you didn't have to be so harsh!",
316,,Chizuko,"Hm? Aren't you friends with *, Mami?",
317,,Mami,"Ugh, no. What nonsense have you been filling Chizuko's head with?",
318,,Mizue,"Mamiko, you should be kinder to your friends.",
319,,？？？,"Ms. Mizue, her name is Mami, not Mamiko.",
320,,Mizue,Keiko? What did you just say? What about Mamiko?,
321,,Keiko,"I said, her name is Mami, not Mamiko!",
322,,Mizue,"Oh yes, Mami, Mami, that's her name. Old age has chipped away at my hearing, I'm afraid.",
323,,*,"Mamiko? Sounds like a cute name, and makes you and Chizuko seem more like sisters-Ouch!",
324,,Keiko,(Headbutts *) NOT MAMIKO! MAMI!,
325,,Mami,"Good job, Keiko! And Ms. Mizue...I am by no means friends with this outsider.",
326,,Kugatsu,"And you probably shouldn't be. We shouldn't be too trusting of outsiders, Ms. Mizue.",
327,,Mizue,"Haha, you worry too much, Kugatsu. Old age has done a number on my hearing, but not on my sight nor my judge of character: I can see that this youngster here is good at heart.",
328,,Kugatsu,"...If you say so, Ms. Mizue.",
329,,*,"Aww, I'm so touched, Ms. Mizue! By the way, why does Senior Priestess Kugatsu treat Ms. Mizue so respectfully? I thought she was the leader of this Shrine?",
330,,Mami,"Ms. Mizue is the Head Priestess of Tsuruga Grand Shrine. While Senior Priestess Kugatsu manages most worldly matters now, all of us respect Ms. Mizue very much.",
331,,*,"I can see that, since your attitude towards me softened remarkably when Ms. Mizue came up. I have another question: why does Keiko opposes calling you Mamiko so vehemently?",
332,,Keiko,"Everyone's name ends with ""-ko"" in the Shrine. Mami is one of the precious few whose name doesn't follow this pattern, and I don't want her to change her name!",
333,,*,"Lemme think, I know five people from this Shrine, and the only two whose names end in ""-ko"" are Chizuko and Keiko. That's not a lot.",
334,,Chizuko,"Well, we also have Tamako, Chiko, Kyouko, Sakurako...Keiko and I are not the only ones with names like that.",
335,,Keiko,"We were orphans when the Shrine took us in. Ms. Mizue named all of us, which is why all our names end with ""-ko"".",
336,,Keiko,Mami is different: it's the name her parents gave her. It shouldn't be changed to be like us.,
337,,Mami,Most Shrine Maidens in the Shrine were abandoned by their parents. As for myself...I arrived after my parents passed away.,
338,,Mami,"Keiko still has faith in parents, and seems to believe that as long as the name doesn't end in ""-ko"", the child isn't abandoned.",
339,,*,I'm sorry to hear that. So Chizuko was...,
340,,Mami,"...Yes, but different. Usually, families who couldn't afford to raise a child will send their daughters here. We've never met Chizuko's parents: she was found in front of the Shrine's gates.",
341,,Mami,"It was snowing that day. If I wasn't sent to run errands out of the Shrine, I wouldn't have found her in time...but she was still left in the snow for far too long. I believe the over-exposure to the cold has affected her health.",
342,,,……,
343,,*,So all of them were orphans...I see why Mami cares so much about Chizuko now: she was the one who found her in the snow.,
344,,*,"All thanks to Enbi no Mikoto, they have a place to call home now. I should check back on Uriel to see whether she's up. It's probably time for us to visit Ms. Mizue for more stories.",
345,,Izanami,……,
346,,*,"...Wait, isn't that... I know you!",
347,,*,"You're...Izanami, right?",
348,,Izanami,"Observer of Yume. I wasn't planning on meeting you so soon, but since you have so generously given yourself up…",
349,,*,(Uriel isn't here... I'm not sure if I can best her in battle.),
350,,Izanami,You don't have to look so alarmed; I wasn't planning on actually fighting you in the Shrine.,
351,,*,"So you will do so when we're not in the confines of it? I'll take note of that when we eventually leave here. It's a truce now, right?",
352,,Izanami,You shouldn't trust the words of your enemy. I could be waiting for you to lower your guard and strike when you're least expecting me to.,
353,,*,"But you're not doing that, are you? Besides, I can feel the waves of depression that are rolling off of you right now...",
354,,Izanami,"This is why I detest those like you: way too perceptive for your own good... But that's not what I'm here for. Have you, by chance, met my Izanagi?",
355,,,Izanami described Izanagi's appearance in meticulous detail.,
356,,*,"I don't think I've ever met someone like that, sorry. Is she important to you? I'd ask the others if they have seen her.",
357,,Izanami,"She is my beloved... While I highly doubt that you can, if you manage to reunite us, I can leave Kratos' forces and join Yume.",
358,,Izanami,Now off you go: you should be heading to the Shrine Office for stories at this hour of the day.,
359,,*,How do you know that?? Have you been stalking me??,
360,Origin of the Trials,Uriel,Oh my... I can't believe I overslept. This is unbecoming behavior for a knight...,
361,,Uriel,I missed training too... I should wake up earlier tomorrow to make up for what I missed today.,
362,,*,"Hey, hey, don't be too hard on yourself. A character you like very much got the happy ending she deserved, and you're excited because of this. It's understandable.",
363,,Uriel,"She reminds me of Belinus, of what might have happened if... but that has nothing to do with slacking off at training!",
364,,Uriel,It will become a habit if I am not careful.,
365,,Mizue,"...As I said last time, Homura-Ōmikami slew Ao Oni, and ordered Enbi no Mikoto to establish a Shrine in Their honor.",
366,,Mizue,"Yet Ao Oni and Aka Oni are immortal; they draw energy from negative emotions, and will eventually regenerate their destroyed bodies and bring doom to Sawagi.",
367,,Mizue,Homura-Ōmikami imparted the knowledge that the amount of time the two brothers need to recover depends on the extent of damage done to their corpses.,
368,,Mizue,"To prolong their recovery, Homura-Ōmikami burned Aka Oni's body to ashes as well.",
369,,Mizue,"The ashes of the two brothers were sealed in another plane of existence created by the God, and it is only accessible from a room in the Shrine.",
370,,Mizue,"From their remains, their energies manifest as brutal monsters. Defeating such monsters will also help against their revival.",
371,,Mizue,"Entering the plane that we call the ""Realm of Trials"" to battle the monsters is an age-old tradition of our Shrine.",
372,,Mizue,"Shrine Maidens of Tsuruga as well as courageous people of Sawagi braved the Realm of Trials to engage in combat with the monsters, hoping to lengthen the time the Brothers needed to recover.",
373,,Mizue,"However, they were horribly outnumbered by the monsters, and casualties were large. Enbi no Mikoto prayed to Homura-Ōmikami, pleading the God for assistance.",
374,,Mizue,"In response to Enbi no Mikoto's prayers, Homura-Ōmikami created two artifacts:",
375,,Mizue,"One of them is the Pond of Prayers. It takes the shape of a regular pond, but is in fact a bottomless reserve of treasures and artifacts.",
376,,Mizue,"True to its name, it will grant every wish and prayer.",
377,,Mizue,"However, it does not allow everyone to tap into its resources. This is where the second artifact, the ""Gaze of Gods"", comes in.",
378,,Mizue,"The ""Gaze of Gods"" is rumored to be a mirror that reflects nothing. One can reach into the mirror and obtain a key to the Pond of Prayers.",
379,,Mizue,"It is said that if you see yourself reflected in the ""Gaze of Gods"", it means that God is watching you through the mirror.",
380,,Mizue,"The mirror was entrusted to Enbi no Mikoto, who never hesitated to share the keys to challengers of the Trials.",
381,,Mizue,"The keys were shaped similar to the cranes who served the God, hence their name ""Origami Cranes"", or paper-folded cranes.",
382,,Mizue,"Back in the time, we believed those were rewards granted to the brave, and called them ""Symbols of Approval"".",
383,,Mizue,"With treasures and artifacts from the Pond of Prayers, the challengers finally stood a chance against the monsters in the Realm of Trials.",
384,,Uriel,"Ah, so that's how the Trials and the Pond of Prayers came to be...",
385,,*,"Does this mean that with the ""Gaze of Gods"", one can gain access to endless amounts of treasures?",
386,,Mizue,"Enbi no Mikoto showed no discrimination when distributing the ""Symbols of Approval"", as long as the challengers were willing to enter the Realm of Trials.",
387,,Mizue,"However, not everyone held noble intentions; some greedy challengers left as soon as the treasure came into their possession without taking on the monsters.",
388,,Mizue,"Infuriated, Enbi no Mikoto took the treasure back from the challengers that brought the treasure away from the Shrine, and stopped distributing ""Symbols of Approval"" freely. The treasure will only be granted moments before entering the Realm of Trials, and will be taken away once the challengers return from the Trials.",
389,,Uriel,Oh no... I don't believe the challengers will be happy with this change.,
390,,Mizue,"One night, a bunch of evil-willed challengers gathered with the sole aim to kill Enbi no Mikoto and pry the ""Gaze of Gods"" from her cold, dead hands.",
391,,Mizue,"The Shrine Maidens were unfortunately outnumbered, and those who could fight were worn out by the constant fights in the Realm of Trials. They were no match for the challengers.",
392,,Mizue,"Severely wounded, Enbi no Mikoto could only escape to the Realm of Trials with the ""Gaze of Gods"".",
393,,Mizue,The last thing she did was to shatter the mirror and toss the shards into the Realm of Trials so the challengers couldn't get to them.,
394,,Mizue,"As all hope of getting their hands on the sacred artifact was lost, the challengers left the Shrine in defeat. Since then, shards of the ""Gaze of Gods"" were scattered about in the Realm of Trials, never to be seen again.",
395,,Mizue,"The only method to obtain the treasures and ""Symbols of Approval"" was to enter the Realm of Trials and take on the Trials.",
396,,*,What an unbelievable end to this story...,
397,,Uriel,"Why, Enbi no Mikoto, why... Why is it always the ones that shine as bright as the sun that suffer such fates...",
398,,Mizue,"When the first rays of the sun fell upon Enbi no Mikoto's body, she turned into a crane and flew away.",
399,,Mizue,"We believe that she was yet again saved by Homura-Ōmikami, and ascended into the heavens to live happily ever after.",
400,,Chizuko,"Here you are, I have been looking for you! I guess Uriel cried again at this part of the story, am I right?",
401,,*,And you didn't? I remember you were devastated when Enbi no Mikoto was sold out by the people she sworn to protect. That's unexpected.,
402,,Chizuko,I don't think Enbi no Mikoto died.,
403,,Chizuko,"I believe that God saved her and brought her to the heavens to live happily ever after, just like Ms. Mizue said!",
404,,Uriel,Do you really believe that? That sounds awfully self-deluding...,
405,,Chizuko,But Homura-Ōmikami exists and They adore Enbi no Mikoto! They won't allow Enbi no Mikoto to waste away like that!,
406,,Chizuko,God must have wanted her to live in a better world than this one.,
407,,Chizuko,"I mean, Homura-Ōmikami could descend to the mortal world anytime if Enbi no Mikoto asked her to, and no mortal could stand against the wraith of Gods, right?",
408,,Chizuko,"At least, that's what I want to believe.",
409,,*,"You have a point. With the level of affection the God has shown her, I wouldn't be surprised if any miracles happened.",
410,,Uriel,"I guess so, but I still feel indignant for Enbi no Mikoto. She was a good person, and didn't deserve what the others did to her.",
411,,Uriel,But I suppose I can see it coming... The greedy ones won't be happy with Enbi no Mikoto's decision.,
412,,Chizuko,"According to ""The Chronicles of Tsuruga"", Enbi no Mikoto was only sixteen or seventeen at the time. It's perfectly understandable if her choices weren't very well thought-out.",
413,,*,"It's a pity that the ""Gaze of Gods"" is now lost. Imagine the amount of treasure you'd have if it's still in your possession!",
414,,Chizuko,"Well, you're not the first one to think like that. But anyone who causes mischief in the Shrine will be punished gravely!",
415,,,……,
416,,？？？,"Gaze of Gods, hm? It will be mine!",
417,Broken Trust,,"The next day, I passed the information we gathered so far to Ithil and KongMing.",
418,,*,...And that's all we've learned since we arrived here.,
419,,KongMing's Projection,"While the credibility of their story is doubtful, it can be deduced that the only method of obtaining the treasure is challenging the Trials.",
420,,Ithil's Projection,"But so far, they are the only source of information that we have. They might very well be making up a story to hide the true source of the treasure.",
421,,Ithil's Projection,...Which I suspect is still hidden somewhere in the Tsuruga Grand Shrine.,
422,,Uriel,"I don't know, the story seems plausible enough for me. Ithil's theory sounds a bit paranoid, to be honest.",
423,,KongMing's Projection,"No matter what the truth is, it is probably not common knowledge among the Shrine Maidens.",
424,,KongMing's Projection,"It's highly possible that only the Head Priestess and Senior Priestess are privy to that knowledge. From how Senpai described them, I doubt that they will be willing to reveal the secret to us.",
425,,*,"Why not? The Yume Academy is clearly the good guys... I mean girls, that fight against the Chaos.",
426,,*,"Surely we can convince the Shrine to supply us with some treasure, can't we? There's no need to go behind their backs.",
427,,KongMing's Projection,"(Sighs) Secrets are meant to be kept, Senpai. They wouldn't be secrets otherwise. As the most well-kept secret of the Tsuruga Grand Shrine, the probabilities of them sharing it with us are very low.",
428,,Ithil's Projection,"So far, the amount of treasure we have gathered from the Trials is inadequate for our cause, and time is not on our side.",
429,,Ithil's Projection,It would be to our advantage to find the source and try to replicate it here at Yume Academy.,
430,,*,... This doesn't sit well with me. Chizuko and Mami are kind and honest people. I'm sure they will be able to see from our perspective if we explained the situation to them.,
431,,*,"It wouldn't hurt to maintain good relationships with members of the Shrine. Since the Shrine Maidens are guardians of the Shrine, they might even be able to assist us in clearing the Trials.",
432,,Uriel,Like how Mami gave me tips on fighting before!,
433,,Ithil's Projection,"... You're the Senpai, I suppose. If you've made up your mind on this, we'll follow your lead.",
434,,*,"Thank you, Ithil.",
435,,Mami,Hmm? Isn't that * and Uriel? Why are they hiding in a corner? Are they speaking to someone?,
436,,Mami,"The most well-kept secret...""treasure""...""be on good relationships with members of the Shrine""… What is this?",
437,,Mami,I am a fool to have thought that you were different from the other outsiders. You outsiders are all greedy and ungrateful brutes who are here for the treasure only!,
438,,*,"What? No, Mami, why are you...",
439,,Mami,I overheard your schemes: your friendly act was only a disguise so you could steal the secret of the treasures from us!,
440,,Mami,"As no harm has been done yet, the Shrine's rules forbid me from taking any action.",
441,,Mami,"But I will be watching you. The moment you start something shady, I will be sure to make you regret every life choice of yours that led you to Tsuruga Grand Shrine. Hmph!",
442,,*,"Please, Mami, this is not what it looks like...",
443,,Uriel,"It's a misunderstanding, Mami, we can explain...",
444,,*,"Oh no, she just left without hearing us out. What should we do now?",
445,,*,And I was so close to befriending her...,
446,,Chizuko,"*, Uriel! What are you doing in this secluded corner? And why do you look so dejected?",
447,,Chizuko,"Did anything bad happen? If you are in the mood to talk, I'm all ears. I heard it's therapeutic to say what's bothering you out loud!",
448,,*,"Mami is mad at us, and I don't know what to do...",
449,,Uriel,There was a misunderstanding that we need to clear up. Do you know where we can find her?,
450,,Chizuko,"Erm, if Mami doesn't want to be found, I can guarantee you that no one will find her. I can try to pass on a message for you though!",
451,,*,"Thank you, Chizuko, but I think we should explain to her in person to avoid any more misunderstandings.",
452,,*,"Is it possible to arrange a meeting with her? Please? If she refuses to meet us, then I suppose we would have no choice but to write her a letter and hope that it reaches her.",
453,,Chizuko,"It's...hard, but not impossible, I think. Mami likes me a lot, and if I beg her, she might relent.",
454,,Chizuko,"It's not every day that you see Mami being on speaking terms with outsiders, and I think it's doing her a lot of good. I want all of you, especially her, to be happy, so I'll try my best!",
455,,*,"You're a lifesaver, Chizuko. We're relying on you.",
456,,,……,
457,,Uriel,I hope Chizuko can convince Mami to meet us...,
458,,*,"If she can't, then our only option is to leave her a letter, hoping that she'll actually read it. Anyhow, we must do our best to clear up this misunderstanding. We are not the greedy outsiders that she seems to believe us to be.",
459,,Izanami,"We meet again, Observer.",
460,,Uriel,"Be on guard, Senpai; she is a member of Krato's forces.",
461,,Izanami,"You haven't mentioned our encounter to your bodyguard, have you?",
462,,*,"It's okay, Uriel, I met her before. She wouldn't make a move on us now.",
463,,Uriel,What?! When did this happen?,
464,,*,On the day you overslept.,
465,,Uriel,"Do you have any idea how dangerous this is, Senpai? She could have killed you or seriously hurt you, and I would be blaming myself for shirking my responsibilities for the rest of my life!",
466,,*,"Relax, Uriel. I'm here and unscathed, am I not?",
467,,Izanami,"Hm, as entertaining as this was, shouldn't you be off to the storytelling session of the Shrine Maidens at this hour? What's keeping you?",
468,,*,"Yeah, about that...apparently we're bad, greedy people that have eyes only on the secrets of the Shrine now. In fact, Mami might be telling Ms. Mizue about us right now.",
469,,*,"So, probably not the best time for us to show up.",
470,,Izanami,"Secrets of the Shrine... You are talking about the ""Gaze of Gods"", aren't you?",
471,,Uriel,"Wait, you know about it too?",
472,,Izanami,"Oh, I saw it in its full glory. Since you're not going to hear this story from the Shrine Maidens, you might as well hear it from me.",
473,,Izanami,"After all, I do know a thing or two about what happened afterwards.",
474,Story time with Izanami,Izanami,"I can't remember the exact period of time when it happened, only that it happened long after Homura-Ōmikami swept Enbi no Mikoto away from the mortal world.",
475,,Izanami,"At that time, the Deity frequently made its presence known, sending messages to Shrine Maidens or causing miracles to happen.",
476,,*,"Huh, that's oddly detailed. One would think that you have actually lived through all this from the way you're telling this story.",
477,,Izanami,And what if I have?,
478,,Uriel,"Really? So is it true that Enbi no Mikoto isn't dead, just far away from here?",
479,,Izanami,She might be.,
480,,Uriel,Why do I feel like you're just trying to brush me aside?,
481,,Izanami,"One day, Ao Oni and Aka Oni reappeared to the astonishment of everyone.",
482,,Izanami,"The Shrine Maidens estimated that it would have taken more time for them to revive. Not only have they revived before the expected time, but they were also more powerful than before.",
483,,Uriel,"Ugh, those two again. Why did that happen?",
484,,Izanami,"Because of Chaos. They drew power from Chaos, which sped up their regeneration.",
485,,*,"You don't do cliffhangers, do you?",
486,,Izanami,"What for? You wanted to know what happened, and I'm telling you. If you wanted a storyteller, you'd have to look elsewhere.",
487,,*,"No, no, please continue. You mentioned Chaos, right? Just how far back in history do the Chaos go?",
488,,Izanami,"It's a mystery. After the monsters left the Realm of Trials, a mirror flew out of the Realm and landed in the hands of the then Head Priestess.",
489,,Izanami,"Rumor went that the ""Gaze of Gods"" will only appear at the Brothers' resurrection.",
490,,Izanami,"However, the treasure was ineffective against the monsters themselves. Allied with the forces of Chaos, the Brothers set out to take revenge on those that tried to stop their revival.",
491,,Izanami,"At times, they submerged Sawagi with water, and other times they wrecked the land with droughts. The Forces of Chaos took the opportunity to harvest as many human lives as they could.",
492,,Izanami,"The Sawagi people were not worried at first. After all, they had their own God watching over their home.",
493,,Izanami,They gradually lost their confidence as the Deity failed to respond no matter how much the Shrine Maidens prayed.,
494,,Izanami,"In their panic, they flocked to the Shrine for refuge. It was the only establishment with the ability to protect everyone, with a team of Shrine Maidens trained specially to fight against the monsters in the Realm of Trials.",
495,,Izanami,Most made it to the Shrine. Some unfortunate ones didn't.,
496,,,"Izanami paused in her narration, absentmindedly touching the purple crystals on her face.",
497,,,"A tear slipped from her eye as she lost herself in her memories, muttering to a person that left her and broke her heart:",
498,,Izanami,"Izanagi, Izanagi... Don't look at me...",
499,,Izanami,"I am not infected by Chaos... I am not deformed... I will find a cure, as you wished...",
500,,Izanami,Don't leave...,
501,,Uriel,"W-What's going on, Senpai? She looks distressed.",
502,,Uriel,"(Whispers) From what she's saying, this Izanagi person left her because they thought she was ""deformed""?",
503,,*,(Whispers) She told me that Izanagi was her lover.,
504,,*,"Snap out of it, Izanami! Izanagi is not here!",
505,,Izanami,"No... You are not here... Where have you gone? I will find you again, Izanagi...",
506,,Uriel,"This isn't right... No matter who this Izanagi person is, they shouldn't have left their beloved because they were infected and scarred by Chaos.",
507,,Uriel,"...Wait a minute, what if this is another misunderstanding, just like Mami and us?",
508,,Uriel,Perhaps that is not the whole truth...,
509,,Uriel,"Yes, Izanagi might have left you without a goodbye, but what if they caught wind of a cure, and had to leave at once or risk losing the lead?",
510,,Uriel,And they never returned because they haven't found the cure and vowed not to return until they have done so. They wanted your reunion to be a happy one.,
511,,Izanami,"Is that so... Is this why you never returned, Izanagi? Because you love me?",
512,,*,It's likely!,
513,,*,(Whispers) Are you sure? She looks hopeful.,
514,,Uriel,"(Whispers) Not really, but the possibility exists.",
515,,Uriel,"(Whispers) Besides, if Izanagi truly abandoned her, then I highly doubt that they will ever meet each other again. What's the harm in letting her have some hope?",
516,,Uriel,"Chizuko's positivity is infectious; I want to believe that there is potential for every story to lead to a happy ending. Even yours, Izanami.",
517,,Izanami,"Hmph, I know that you're just trying to comfort me, but you did open my eyes to the possibility.",
518,,Izanami,"If we meet on opposite sides of the battlefield next time, I can spare your lives once.",
519,,*,"Gee, thanks, I feel so loved. I'd appreciate it a lot if we don't end up as enemies though.",
520,,Izanami,"... We should continue with the story. The Shrine Maidens never lost hope, and prayed to Homura-Ōmikami day and night.",
521,,Izanami,"Finally, The Deity responded to their prayers: the sun rose at midnight with the shrill chirp of a crane one night.",
522,,Izanami,"Bright rays of dawn chased away the night that enveloped Sawagi, and the Brothers were yet again reduced to ashes when sunlight fell upon them.",
523,,Izanami,"The people say that the sun was the manifestation of Homura-Ōmikami, and the crane that flew beside the sun as it climbed above the horizon was Enbi no Mikoto.",
524,,Izanami,"The Forces of Chaos were vanquished, and the ashes of Ao Oni and Aka Oni were returned to the Shrine.",
525,,Izanami,"The Shrine Maidens sealed both their ashes and the ""Gaze of Gods"" back into the Realm of Trials.",
526,,Izanami,"After renovations to the buildings wrecked by the Brothers' breakout were finished, Tsuruga Grand Shrine hosted a Grand Ceremony to express their thanks to the God, yet received no response.",
527,,Izanami,"In fact, that was the last time the God was seen in Sawagi.",
528,,Izanami,"However, the Sawagi people believed that Homura-Ōmikami never left them, since the Pond of Prayers still functioned as before.",
529,,*,And you lived through all of this? Wow...,
530,,Izanami,"Some are my own experiences, and others I gathered from the locals when I returned later.",
531,,Izanami,I do not trust that God: They are not as good and noble as the Sawagi people believe Them to be.,
532,,Izanami,"All They want was the faith of Their disciples: if They did care, They could have destroyed the Chaos anytime! And I would never be deformed by these vile scars!",
533,,Uriel,"I-I think I have heard about this. Before I came to Yume Academy, that is.",
534,,Uriel,"When I still belonged to the Order of the Sun, a senior knight once told me that her team was assigned to defend a region against Chaos, and to take down a God that has taken residence there.",
535,,Uriel,"However, the Chaos were destroyed when they arrived. The locals said it was a miracle.",
536,,Uriel,They investigated and found that the God died protecting the land from Chaos.,
537,,Uriel,"Now that I think about it... She said that the land was named ""Sawagi"".",
538,,Uriel,I don't know why They didn't take any action against the Chaos in the beginning. Perhaps it wrongly believed that the Chaos was no match for it... and paid dearly for this misjudgment.,
539,,Izanami,"Homura-Ōmikami died... protecting us? I, I don't...",
540,,,……,
541,,？？？,"(Cackles) Ah, Ahhh, so the Brothers' resurrection is tied to the ""Gaze of Gods""... I know just the thing to do now!",
