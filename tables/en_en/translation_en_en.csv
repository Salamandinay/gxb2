Join forces with Guild members to defeat powerful enemies in Sky Island.|Member Restrictions:|When Sky Island begins, players cannot quit Guild, remove a Guild member or disband Guild. Joining or creating a Guild is unaffected.|Score Rule|Each enemy can provide 100K Points in total, you will win their points according to the damage you deal. Points will be calculated based on the HP percentage of the enemy that was lowered in the Real Battle.|Challenge Chances:|1. Each Guild member has a maximum of 3 Challenges per day.

3. Demo Battle: No Challenges are consumed for this training battle, and no rewards or points can be earned in this mode. Demo Battle is still available even when Challenge chances have reached 0. When Demo Battle begins, the HP of enemies in this mode is the actual amount of HP the enemy has left in Real Battle.|Rewards:|1. Battle Rewards: Rewards can be obtained after each battle.
2. Boss Defeat Rewards: Guild Members who participated in defeating the enemy will receive rewards when the enemy is defeated.
3. Damage Rank Rewards: Guild members will be ranked according to points obtained from attacking enemies. The ranking of points obtained from enemies with different names will be calculated separately (e.g. the points you obtained by attacking one enemy from Lv1 to the highest level you reach will be calculated in a separate ranking list from the other 2 ranking lists made for the other 2 enemies). The Damage Rank Rewards will be sent via Mail after Sky Island ends.
  When there are less than 10 participants of Sky Island in a Guild, the Damage Rank Rewards obtained will be lowered by 10%% for each participant missing. The Damage Rank Rewards will be lowered for at most 90%%.
4. Guild Rank Rewards: Guilds will be ranked according to the total points earned from Real Battle. Once Sky Island ends, rewards according to rank will be sent to Guild members with more than 0 points. Frames will be added directly to the players’ accounts, and other rewards will still need to be claimed via Mail. (If players quit a Guild, are removed from their Guild or the Guild is disbanded, rewards can still be obtained)"

Ultimate League is a league for all players in the game to compete together.
Each Season of Ultimate League lasts for 28 days and is divided into 5 phases: Preparation Phase, Points Race, Single Elimination, Finals, and Exhibition Period.|1. Preparation Phase|The first day of each season is the Preparation Phase: players can set up their defense lineup during this period, but they cannot engage in battles.|2. Points Race|(1) During the 2nd – 20th day of each season, players will be able to compete in Points Race.
(2) Players can challenge other players by consuming League Tickets. If players are dissatisfied with their matched opponents, they can refresh to be matched with new opponents. Each player can refresh 7 times max in a day.
(3) The number of League Tickets consumed is based on the number of battles started every day. The 1st to 5th battles cost 2 League Tickets each, the 6th to 10th battles cost 3 League Tickets each, the 11th to 15th battles cost 4 League Tickets each, and every battle starting from the 16th battle cost 5 League Tickets each. This resets every day.
(4) The 10 most recent Battle Records can be viewed.|3. Divisions|(1) There are 6 Divisions in Score Match: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Master, and Grandmaster. Each Division (except Master and Grandmaster) will be separated into 5 grades, players will need to promote their grades from Grade 5 to Grade 1 before advancing to the next Division.
(2) Players can get promoted by 1 grade for every 100 points. When a player in Master Division reaches rank 320 in overall rankings, they will advance to Grandmaster Division.
(3) Players begin at Bronze Division Grade 5 when first entering the Points Race phase. Their Division and Grade will be reset when a new season of Ultimate League begins. However, players will obtain a one-time bonus in points when a new season starts based on their Division in the last season.
(4) When a player from Bronze, Silver, and Gold Divisions are challenged by another player but lost the battle, they will not lose points. If a player from Diamond Division is challenged but lost the battle, they will lose fewer points than normal. If a player from Master Division is challenged but lost the battle, they will lose points normally.|4. Battle Rules|(1) Ultimate League has applied a new set of battle rules. Players\' lineup will be separated into battle lineup and backup lineup. After a battle is over, the undefeated Girls in the players\' battle lineup will stay on the battlefield and their HP will not be automatically healed to 100%%.The system will try and fill the lineup back to a full team by using Girls from the Backup Lineup (the system will prioritize setting Backup Girls in Frontline or Backline based on their positions in the Backup Lineup). Then the next round of battle will begin. It will end once all Girls of a player\'s lineup have been defeated.
(2)Each Girl can participate in 2 battles at most. If they have not been defeated by then, she will automatically be removed and considered as defeated.
(3) Players can also set the order of Servants. When a battle is lost, the system will place the Servant selected as second option in battle. If a battle is won, the first Servant will remain in the player\'s lineup and be replaced by the next Servant after the 2nd battle.
(4) Backup Girl number and Servants available will be increased according to the players\' Division:
Bronze: no backup
Silver: 2 Frontline backup, 4 Backline backup, 2 Servants
Gold: 4 Frontline backup, 8 Backline backup, 3 Servants
Diamond: 8 Frontline backup, 16 Backline backup, 5 Servants
(5) When challenging other players, the number of slots available in your backup lineup will be adjusted according to your opponent\'s Division.
(6) If the battle exceeds 15 rounds, Girls remaining will increase their Attack and lower their Heal received each round until the battle is over.|5. Single Elimination & Finals|(1) After Points Race is over, the 320 players in Grandmaster Division will be randomly separated into 5 groups (64 players per group) and enter Single Elimination Phase. If there are less than 320 players but more than 64 players in Grandmaster Division, players from Grandmaster Division will be picked according to their position in the ranking list until the remaining players in Grandmaster Division cannot form a complete group. In this case, they will not enter Single Elimination Phase. If there are less than 64 players in Grandmaster Division, players from other Divisions will be picked according to their position on the ranking list (until there\'re 64 players for the Single Elimination Phase).
(2) 1 race will be held each day.0:00 to 2:00 (UTC/GMT 0) is the ending period. The players cannot set or adjust their lineups within 2 hours before each round of battle and during the ending period.
(3) Only Girls that can be awakened to 10-star can be deployed in Single Elimination and Finals. During battles, all Girls will have the attributes of their 15-Star form at level 330 and their Elite Skill upgrade progress will be kept. They will also be equipped with a full Angel Set (Girls equipped with Class Set Gears will still equip their original Gears), and have their Crystals set at the highest grade, the upgrades of Astral Core Nodes will be kept. The Servant deployed will be at level 180, the Servant\'s Aura level will be at level 50, and the Servant\'s Ulticore level will be kept. Guild Lab skills will be fully upgraded. Attributes from Costume Wardrobe, Chimes, Main Center in Excursion, Skins, Antiques originally held by the Girl, the Girl\'s current intimacy boost, and the Girl\'s potential status will be kept. If the girl hasn\'t chosen her potential boost in a slot it will be considered empty.
During battles, the HP and Attack of every Girl will be multiplied based on their star-grade:|5-Star-50%%, 6-Star-51%%, 7-Star-53%%|8-Star-55%%, 9-Star-60%%, 10-Star-65%%|11-Star-70%%, 12-Star-75%%, 13-Star-80%%|14-Star-90%%, 15-Star-100%%|6. Exhibition|(1) Exhibition will last for 2 days after Finals end.|7. Hall of Fame|(1) The top 8 players from each Single Elimination Group of each season will be recorded in the Hall of Fame.
(2) Records of players who have won in Ultimate League before the feature is updated will still be taken into account in Rankings.|8. Ultimate League Task|(1) During the Points Race period, players can get rewards by completing Tasks in Ultimate League every day.|9. Seasonal Rewards|(1) After Points Race period is over, players will be awarded according to their current Division.
Notice: Players will need to start 10 or more battles to receive Seasonal Rewards.
(2) Once the Finals period is over, limited frames that last for 28 days will be issued to players who entered Finals according to their ranks."
