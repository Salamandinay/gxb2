1,Anniversary Party,,"Years have passed since the foundation of Yume Academy, and the number of students and staff has grown exponentially.",
2,,,"Multiple new students have enrolled in Yume Academy just this year, and the forces of the Academy is stronger than ever before.",
3,,,(Knock knock),
4,,Chizuko,Who's there?,
5,,*,"It's me, your Senpai! Did you forget that the Anniversary Party is today?",
6,,Chizuko,"Hi, Senpai! How can I forget something like this? I've been waiting for you to pick me up!",
7,,Chizuko,I thought you ditched me since you never showed up…,
8,,*,"My bad, my bad. I spent way too much time worrying about what I should wear to the Party.",
9,,Chizuko,"Um, and this is what you decided on?",
10,,*,Yep! How do I look?,
11,,Chizuko,… Nice! You look quite nice!,
12,,*,I sense a strange pause before your answer…,
13,,Chizuko,"Haha, you're reading too much into this! As long as you're satisfied with your appearance, others' opinions don't matter! Come on, let's go to the Party before we're late!",
14,,*,"Sounds fake, but okay…",
15,,,"Chizuko and I arrived at the Hall where the Party is held. Upon entering the gates, the sight of Promethea and Syrcotte chatting greeted us.",
16,,Syrcotte,……,
17,,Promethea,"Did I frighten you? Pardon me, that was not my intention…",
18,,Syrcotte,"Oh, no, not at all! It's just the first time I've seen fire that burns cold instead of hot, so I can't help but be curious.",
19,,Syrcotte,"I made you uncomfortable with my staring, didn't I?",
20,,Promethea,"It's okay, I'm used to being stared at.",
21,,Syrcotte,If you don't mind me asking…,
22,,Syrcotte,… How did you end up like this?,
23,,Promethea,"Well, this isn't really taboo. This is a punishment from the Ruler of Gods.",
24,,Syrcotte,The Ruler of Gods?,
25,,Promethea,She is the god that rules over other deities… I stole from her and disobeyed her orders…,
26,,Syrcotte,"While stealing is wrong and most certainly not encouraged, I believe there is a reason behind the theft.",
27,,Promethea,……,
28,,Promethea,The Ruler of Gods' orders were to be obeyed at all costs.,
29,,Promethea,I defied her orders and was punished accordingly.,
30,,*,"Hey, what are you girls talking about? The topic seems to be a bit too gloomy for the Party!",
31,,Syrcotte,"Hello, Senpai, you're finally here.",
32,,Chizuko,"Syrcotte, Promethea, hi!",
33,,Promethea,"Senpai, Chizuko. Now that you're here, Sivney could finally start her Opening Speech. She was waiting for you.",
34,,Chizuko,"If Senpai didn't spend such a long time picking out an outfit, then we would have been here on time!",
35,,*,Whoops?,
36,,*,"By the way, what brought the topic of Promethea's past up?",
37,,Promethea,……,
38,,Syrcotte,"Ah, that would be my fault. I insisted on asking her about her misfortunes, which I shouldn't have.",
39,,Syrcotte,We ought to be discussing something more befitting of the situation. I myself would like to hear about the past of Yume Academy from Senpai.,
40,,*,"Hmm, you should ask the founding members about that, such as the Valkyries!",
41,,Valeera,I hear someone mention the Valkyries! Who is it?,
42,,Sivney,"The Valkyrie? Oh, Senpai's here! He finally bothered to show up.",
43,,Valeera,I think everyone's here. It's time to start the Celebration Party!,
44,Cherry Blossom Soda,Sivney,"Ehem, may I have all of your attention please?",
45,,Sivney,"You have all worked hard this year, so I proposed this party to KongMing as a chance for all of us to relax and have fun…",
46,,Sivney,… And here you are!,
47,,Chizuko,"Senpai, Sivney's speech started!",
48,,Sivney,The Banquet Hall now boasts an all-you-can-eat buffet and a free bar.,
49,,Sivney,Aquaris also has some minigames ready at the Game Corner and is awaiting your participation!,
50,,*,"Oooh, a Game Corner! Sounds fun! I wonder what types of minigames there will be…",
51,,Chizuko,Why am I not surprised that that's the only thing you heard?,
52,,*,"Hey, games are good exercise for both mind and body!",
53,,Sivney,"The free bar is run by Hermes, while we have Sonya to thank for the buffet.",
54,,Sivney,Refreshments are free for all!,
55,,KongMing,"Wait, what? This wasn't a part of our agreement… Does the Student Union have enough funds to pay for all of this…",
56,,Sivney,"Enjoy the party, everyone!",
57,,Chizuko,"Woah, a free bar! That means alcohol, right?",
58,,*,"Don't even think about it, Chizuko.",
59,,*,"You're underage, and Ms. Mizue asked me to keep an eye on you.",
60,,Chizuko,But… But…,
61,,*,No.,
62,,Chizuko,Hermes? Can I have some? Please?,
63,,Hermes,"Haha, does the young Chizuko wish to have a drink?",
64,,Chizuko,Yep! With extra sugar and honey!,
65,,*,Sugar and honey?,
66,,Chizuko,Yes!! I've always wanted to try Sweet Rice Wine!,
67,,*,"Ah, is that what the Shrine Maidens have back at Tsuruga Grand Shrine?",
68,,Chizuko,It is! So can I have some?,
69,,*,Nope.,
70,,Hermes,"It wouldn't hurt too much if she just had a taste, would it? This is a day of festivities after all.",
71,,*,I can't believe I have to spell this out for you: Chizuko is underage! No alcohol for her!,
72,,Chizuko,"Aww, Senpai's no fun. What types of non-alcoholic drinks do you have then, Hermes?",
73,,Hermes,"Well, I do have some Cherry-Blossom flavored soda…",
74,,Chizuko,"Soda! Yes, Hermes, soda sounds good. Cherry Blossom-flavored, you said?",
75,,Hermes,Here you go.,
76,,Hermes,What do you think? Do you like it?,
77,,Chizuko,Yum! I feel as if I'm being enveloped in a rain of Cherry Blossom petals when I drink this! It's awesome!,
78,,Chizuko,"May I have some more, please?",
79,,Hermes,"Haha, sure.",
80,,Chizuko,…This reminds me of the Cherry Trees in the Shrine…,
81,,Hermes,I'm glad to hear that you find it pleasing to your tastes.,
82,Chizuko's Faith,Hermes,About the Shrine… I'm afraid my knowledge of the deity you worship is limited. Would you mind enlightening me on this matter?,
83,,Chizuko,"Ah, are you interested in Homura-Ōmikami? I'd love to tell you all about Them!",
84,,Chizuko,"Basically, They are the one our faith belongs to, and this doesn't mean the faith of just us Shrine Maidens. Everyone in the Tsuruga Region worships Homura-Ōmikami!",
85,,Chizuko,It is due to Their blessings that we mortals do not suffer in life.,
86,,Hermes,I see. Would you say that you would offer your life if They asked you to?,
87,,Chizuko,My life? They have no need for the feeble powers that we hold.,
88,,Chizuko,"Hehe, but if They really need me for anything, I will give all I have!",
89,,Hermes,(Hmm… It does seem easy to manipulate people's actions in the name of a deity…),
90,,Chizuko,(Yawns) I feel so sleepy… Why does this party have to be held at night? It's way past bedtime in the Shrine…,
91,,*,"Well, kids will be kids, I suppose.",
92,,*,"Super hyper one moment, then just crashes the next.",
93,,Chizuko,Hehe…Zzzzz,
94,,Hermes,"Senpai, if Chizuko is tired, she can rest here with me.",
95,,Hermes,"Would you like that, Chizuko? You can have this sofa.",
96,,Chizuko,Hmm…,
97,,Hermes,(The wonders of faith... What makes them so trusting and pious? Is it because of a lack of competence and a lack of self-awareness?),
98,,Hermes,(Mutters) I don't think the kid will be of much help answering my questions about the deity now that she's sleepy…,
99,,Chizuko,"(Yawns) I can't keep my eyes open… Can I borrow your sofa, Hermes?",
100,,*,Seriously?,
101,,Hermes,"Don't worry, Senpai. I don't mind looking after this cutie here for a while.",
102,,Hermes,Let her sleep.,
103,,Chizuko,"Thank you, Hermes…Zzzzzz",
104,,,Chizuko fell asleep again on the sofa behind the counter of the bar.,
105,,*,Oh no… What should I do now?,
106,,Hermes,"As I said before, I can watch over her when she sleeps. You don't have to wait here until she wakes up.",
107,,*,Are you sure this is okay?,
108,,Hermes,"Go, shoo. Don't worry, she'll still be here when you return.",
109,,,……,
110,,Syrcotte,"Promethea, would you like a refill?",
111,,Promethea,"No, but thank you for the offer, Syrcotte. I might lose control of my Hellfire if I consume any more. That would be rather disastrous.",
112,,Syrcotte,It must be tiring to maintain such a high level of self-control at all times…,
113,,Promethea,I'm used to it now. Don't let it affect you; you can have a refill if you want to. I won't feel left out.,
114,,Syrcotte,"Al-Alright, if you insist.",
115,Syrcotte's Past,Syrcotte,"Hello, Hermes. Do you have any sweet osmanthus-flavored drinks?",
116,,Hermes,"I sure do! The flower-flavored drinks are rather popular today, I must say. Chizuko liked her Cherry Blossom soda a lot.",
117,,,Hermes finished mixing the drink Syrcotte requested and slid the glass across the counter. Syrcotte took a sip.,
118,,Syrcotte,"Now that you mention her, I haven't seen Chizuko for a while. Where is she?",
119,,Hermes,"Haha, she's asleep on my sofa now.",
120,,Hermes,"She's adorable, and even sleep-talks about her precious god.",
121,,Syrcotte,"Ah, the rumored ""Homura-Ōmikami"" of the Tsuruga Grand Shrine? It's not the easiest name to memorize.",
122,,Hermes,"Do you believe in the existence of gods and deities, Syrcotte?",
123,,Syrcotte,"You have to be more specific before I can answer that question. We can start with defining what you mean by ""god"" or ""deity"".",
124,,Hermes,"Hmm, a recipient of faith? A shared belief that supports a person? An omnipotent force that demands obedience?",
125,,Hermes,"Or an amalgam of all three? What do you think, Syrcotte?",
126,,Syrcotte,"I think this is getting way too complicated, but yes, I agree that a God should be an entity whose authority the people don't question.",
127,,Syrcotte,"As a matter of fact, I was speaking to Promethea just now. Apparently, she was punished by the Ruler of Gods, and she has no qualms with her punishment.",
128,,Syrcotte,The Ruler of Gods must be extremely powerful to punish other gods and goddesses…,
129,,Hermes,The Ruler of Gods? The god among gods…,
130,,Syrcotte,Did I say something weird?,
131,,Hermes,"Oh, no. I just didn't expect there to be a being powerful enough to bind a goddess like Promethea to their will.",
132,,Syrcotte,"Gods aren't as free as we humans imagined them to be, are they?",
133,,Syrcotte,"We're more similar than we thought: a less-powerful god fears and obeys a more-powerful god, just like how humans fear and obey gods.",
134,,,Syrcotte was suddenly reminded of the dark past of her city when the shadows of Chaos obscured the moon and pained screams echoed in the lightless night.,
135,,Man A,"My, my wife is taken by the black monster… Please, I beg you, please save her… Why?? Why are you subduing me instead of the monster?!",
136,,Man A,Hey! Aren't you the enforcers of law? Why are you… Let me go! Let me go!,
137,,Guard,The Lord had ordered us to keep details of these cases away from the public… Silence him!,
138,,Woman,Did anything happen last night?,
139,,Man B,"Shh, don't ask about such matters. The Lord has our best interests at heart…",
140,,Hermes,Hello? Syrcotte? You seem to be deep in thought.,
141,,Syrcotte,"I was reminded of my father. He was no king, but as a Lord, his presence demanded respect. Though I would say it was more due to him keeping his people under a tight grip than it being genuine respect.",
142,,Hermes,I heard there was a Chaos invasion in your city.,
143,,Syrcotte,"There was… however, none of the officials, including my father, was aware of the Chaos influence.",
144,,Syrcotte,We believed that the deaths were either result of an unknown malady or a series of unsolved murders. No one knew about Chaos at the time.,
145,,Hermes,"I find it hard to believe that no suspicions were raised, not even a little.",
146,,Syrcotte,Most believed the incidents were baseless rumors instead of real occurrences.,
147,,Syrcotte,"Few were privy to the knowledge of their existence, but their numbers were thin and they lacked the power to bring the truth to light.",
148,,Syrcotte,"The Chaos hid among our ranks for far too long… Every day, we live without knowing who was Chaos' next target and whether we would live to see the light of the next day.",
149,,Hermes,Surely news of such horrors must have spread like wildfire within the city walls?,
150,,Syrcotte,… You'd be surprised by how well everything was kept under wraps.,
151,,Syrcotte,Witnesses were threatened into silence or marked as liars. Those who caught wind of the rumors dismissed them as mere tales until the dreadful fate befell them…,
152,,Syrcotte,"One wouldn't know what they don't know. They will not be moved by events that they are not aware of, nor will they take any action against the unknown.",
153,,Syrcotte,"There are only two types of response to the unknown: curiosity or fear. When the people learn that satisfying their curiosity comes at a price, they will turn their eyes away from the unknown, pretending that it doesn't exist.",
154,,Syrcotte,"My father promised to protect them, and they trusted him… and yet…",
155,,Hermes,"It is not wise to place one's fate in the words of the ruling class. After all, one decides their own fate.",
156,,Syrcotte,"… In the end, everything was resolved. The Chaos influence was cleansed from the city and the citizens were saved. I dread to imagine what would have happened otherwise…",
157,,Syrcotte,"Had my mother's life not been on the line, my father would probably have had the issue taken care of before the situation escalated…",
158,,Syrcotte,It wasn't his intention for how things turned out…,
159,,Hermes,I see.,
160,,Hermes,"(Kings and lords are like gods, keeping secrets and controlling their subjects… Immortality isn't the deciding factor here.)",
161,,Hermes,(So what should one do to be truly free…?),
162,,Syrcotte,Hermes?,
163,,Hermes,……,
164,,Syrcotte,What's on your mind?,
165,,Hermes,"Oh, nothing important.",
166,The One and Only,Maia,"This ""Pizza"" dish is rather exquisite. Sonya, I demand you add it to the daily menu of the cafeteria. It's such a waste for it to only be served on special occasions only.",
167,,Sonya,Uh… Um… The process of making pizza is pretty complicated!,
168,,Maia,I fail to see how this fact concerns me.,
169,,Sonya,"Since it's complicated and time-consuming, I might not have the time or ingredients to make it every day!",
170,,Maia,"Again, I fail to see how this concerns me. It does, however, concern your capabilities as a chef.",
171,,Sonya,This means that I can't add it to the daily menu of the cafeteria!,
172,,Maia,"Hn. And what, pray tell, shall I do when I find myself with a craving for pizza?",
173,,Maia,My servants show much appreciation for this dish as well.,
174,,Sonya,"Um, well… Since you like it so much, I can make it for you when I have time? You'll have to tell me in advance though!",
175,,Sonya,That's the most I can do!,
176,,Maia,"Ridiculous. From my observations, your two ""friends"" don't meet much resistance when they have requests for you. Are you even aware of the consequences for defying my wishes?",
177,,Sonya,"Look, even if a god came down here and ordered me to do something, I won't be able to do anything beyond my abilities!",
178,,Sonya,"I really don't mean to offend you, since you're a Goddess of Chaos, and I do value my life!",
179,,Maia,"Well, I suppose I can cut you some slack…",
180,,,……,
181,,Maia,"Hermes, I'd like a glass of the best drink on your menu.",
182,,Hermes,"Oh, it's Maia! What delicacies did you have at Sonya's?",
183,,Maia,"One of the special dishes for the Anniversary Party. I requested her to add it to the cafeteria's daily menu, but she claimed that it is beyond her abilities.",
184,,Maia,It's a pity that I can't have it whenever I want to.,
185,,Hermes,"Ah, that explains the long face.",
186,,Maia,The pain is being soothed away by the drink you served. It is more than adequate.,
187,,Hermes,"Huh, you've changed quite a lot, Maia.",
188,,Maia,How so? I doubt that my appearance has been altered in any way.,
189,,Hermes,"Oh, no, it's not about how you look! I just remembered what you were like when you first arrived at the Academy. Everything had to be exactly the way you wanted!",
190,,Maia,"That hasn't changed, I believe. However, I've learned that it's futile to demand too much from you incompetent servants.",
191,,Maia,"All-powerful as I am, I have to admit that it might just be impossible to grant Sonya the ability to make pizza every day.",
192,,Maia,"Hmm, this drink is not bad. I can feel my spirits lifting…",
193,,Hermes,"Only the best for you, Maia.",
194,,Maia,"Finally, someone up to standards. I'm very satisfied with your services, Hermes.",
195,,Hermes,Oh? Hahahahaha…,
196,,Maia,What brought about this sudden burst of laughter? Are you perhaps overwhelmed by joy upon my acknowledgment?,
197,,Hermes,"Of course, why else would I be happy?",
198,,Hermes,You don't get praised by the great Maia every day!,
199,,Maia,"No, I suppose not.",
200,,Hermes,(Cute.),
201,,Hermes,(I wonder what she thinks about Homura-Ōmikami…),
202,,Maia,I can sense you staring at me. Is there a problem?,
203,,Hermes,"Oh, no, I'm just curious. Did you hear how Chizuko is mumbling about ""Homura-Ōmikami"" in her sleep?",
204,,Maia,I have indeed. Though I am more curious as to what came over her…,
205,,Hermes,Do you believe in the existence of gods and deities?,
206,,Maia,Why not? Need I remind you that I am the Goddess of Chaos?,
207,,Hermes,"I mean, gods and deities other than you?",
208,,Maia,In this case… No.,
209,,Maia,"I do not recognize the god that young Chizuko speaks of, nor do I find it worthy of my attention.",
210,,Maia,"It is hardly concerning when my servants still see me as their sole master, still obey my orders, and still worship the ground I walk on.",
211,,Hermes,Aren't you worried that they will betray you someday?,
212,,Maia,Betray me? For whom? That Homura-Ōmikami character? A minor god who is no match for me?,
213,,Maia,"I find mortals pitiful and amusing, Hermes.",
214,,Maia,"I am the only Goddess worthy of their devotion. As long as the mortals keep respecting me and don't disobey me, I might even pity them.",
215,Maia's Arrogance,Maia,"Take young Chizuko, for example. She's rather adorable, though unfortunately misguided.",
216,,Hermes,"Woah, as expected from Maia. Spoken like a Queen.",
217,,Maia,"There's a large difference between Queen and Goddess, Hermes.",
218,,Hermes,People are easily manipulated in the name of gods; words of a god might as well be the law to them.,
219,,Maia,"Ah, mortals. Mindless and powerless individuals who need the presence of deities in their lives for a purpose. Typical.",
220,,Maia,"An accurate observation, Hermes. Certainly not one I would expect from a mortal.",
221,,Hermes,"Aww, I feel so flattered, Maia! Here's your refill!",
222,,Maia,"Hm… Pleasing to the tongue as always. Good work, Hermes.",
223,,Hermes,"As a goddess, you're surprisingly familiar with how a mortal might think. You've even noticed that mortals are weak creatures that can only live under the rule of gods!",
224,,Maia,Pfft. I have no interest in the thought processes of a mortal.,
225,,Hermes,"Maia, the unrivaled Goddess of Chaos. I envy you sometimes.",
226,,Hermes,A being with overwhelming power and an absolute ego. A being truly free and unrestrained…,
227,,Hermes,"(Mutters) If she lived in Syrcotte's city during the Chaos Invasion, she wouldn't have been manipulated that easily by the Lord.",
228,,Hermes,"No, she would be the one to keep asking until she had the truth…",
229,,Maia,……,
230,,Hermes,You fear nothing and follow only your heart's desires…,
231,,Maia,Hermes? I didn't seem to catch what you said.,
232,,Hermes,"Oh, I just recalled Sonya making a special type of pizza that's only available for a limited amount of time. Have you tried it yet?",
233,,Hermes,"(But regular people cannot hope to match the strength of gods and goddesses, and without power, it's too easy to fall under the control of someone else… Is this the limitation of being a human?)",
234,,Maia,"It must have slipped my attention. I must leave now, lest the time-limited flavor is gone.",
235,,*,"Hey Hermes, is Chizuko up yet?",
236,,Hermes,"Nope, still out cold. I saw you chatting with Hottie and Eve in the Date Area.",
237,,*,"Hehe, you got me. They're pretty cool, but that doesn't mean I'll leave Chizuko here alone!",
238,,*,How is she doing? It would be such a pity if she slept through the entire party.,
239,,Hermes,"If you're so worried about her missing out on all the fun, why don't you wake her up yourself?",
240,,,I walked towards the sofa.,
241,,*,"Hey, Chizuko?",
242,,Chizuko,"Zzzzz… Enbi no Mikoto, your beauty is stunning… Zzzzz…",
243,,*,"Chizuko, wake up!",
244,,Chizuko,Wh-what?! Senpai?! Is the party over?,
245,,Hermes,"Calm down, Chizuko, it's not over yet. The minigames are just starting at Aquaris' Game Corner, though you might miss it if you slept any longer. Time to rise and shine~",
246,,Chizuko,(Yawns),
247,,Chizuko,I feel a lot better after taking a nap!,
248,,Chizuko,"Though I'm starting to get hungry… Senpai, can we get something to eat at Sonya's?",
249,,*,"I can't believe… On second thought, I actually can. Sure, let's go grab some food at Sonya's buffet.",
250,,Chizuko,"Hurray! You're the best, Senpai! Then we'll visit Aquaris, right?",
251,Aquaris' New Friend?,Eve,"I guessed correctly, which means that you lost the bet, Aquaris. Are you ready to accompany me for a whole day?",
252,,Aquaris,…Why did I think that placing myself as stakes for a bet was a good idea? Why??,
253,,Aquaris,"Are you sure this is what you want, Eve? I mean, look at these prizes: Memorial Booklet and Map of the Academy, Coupons for Hermes' Store, and a new summer dress! Aren't any of these better than boring old me?",
254,,Chizuko,What's going on here? Why am I hearing that Aquaris lost herself in a bet?,
255,,Eve,"Oh, we're betting on who has the stronger poker hand. The one who guesses correctly gets a prize.",
256,,Eve,"Aquaris promised to hang out with me for an entire day for every correct guess I get, and she owes me quite a few days now.",
257,,Aquaris,"You've been here for the entire night, Eve! And it's not several days, it's more like the next several months!",
258,,Eve,"Well, you're not going to go back on your word, are you? I am quite fond of you, to be honest.",
259,,Eve,Won't you be friends with me?,
260,,Aquaris,You're making it impossible for me to say no…,
261,,,……,
262,,Eve,"Hello, Hermes. Do you have any juice? I'd like some change from what I've been drinking all night.",
263,,Hermes,"Of course. Here you go, Eve.",
264,,Hermes,You seem to be having fun with Aquaris.,
265,,Eve,"Haha, I most certainly did. I like her company.",
266,,Hermes,"Hmm, but is it that simple?",
267,,Eve,Are you insinuating that I have ulterior motives behind my affections? Does it seem like I am incapable to enjoy someone's company from the outside?,
268,,Hermes,"Oh, no, I don't judge that easily.",
269,,Eve,"I'm not fooled by appearances, Hermes, especially not the front of caring nothing but your business that you're putting up. Few things, if any, escape your attention.",
270,,Eve,Most don't know what they want and require guidance. All I want to do is provide assistance on that front.,
271,,Hermes,So… you wish to help Aquaris by guiding her like a goddess?,
272,,Eve,"Perhaps I do. It also wouldn't hurt if she decides to help me in return, would it?",
273,,Eve,"You're a smart person, Hermes. You know what you want.",
274,,Eve,"But the general crowd doesn't share that awareness. Without intelligence or strength to guide them, they will just wander aimlessly and lose themselves in life.",
275,,Eve,"That's where I come in. And as I said, they might even prove useful to me.",
276,,Hermes,You're saying that some sort of faith in gods is necessary for a person?,
277,,Eve,"I am. Human beings need something to support them, something they can rely on, to keep their lives stable. It can be anything, really, not just faith in gods.",
278,,Eve,I seek out those who don't have one yet and offer my assistance.,
279,,Hermes,"You want to play God to the… misguided? Including Aquaris? Haha, do you really take Aquaris to be a lost lamb who desperately needs your help?",
280,,Eve,Perhaps. Who knows for sure?,
281,,Hermes,"I don't know what your endgame is, Eve, but I wish you success.",
282,,Eve,"Thank you, Hermes. The drinks you served were pretty good.",
283,,,……,
284,,Hermes,"(What an interesting crowd this Academy has... Faithful disciples of a god, a Goddess herself, and a human who dreams to become a god… Those who rely on themselves only, and those who believe human beings must be reliant on gods…)",
285,,Hermes,"(If both supernatural and political powers can take on the mask of gods… then what exactly does the concept of ""gods"" entail?)",
286,,,……,
287,,KongMing,"I can see some of you yawning, my fellow schoolmates, as celebrations come to an end.",
288,,KongMing,"We shall be hosting the same events at the same time next year, and I look forward to seeing all of you there.",
289,,Hermes,"Time flies, doesn't it? I can't wait to hear what this bunch has to say next year…",
